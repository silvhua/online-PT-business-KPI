1020,2019-04-10 08:38:32+00:00,one of the most common question i get asked is about a pre match meal  well let me tell you  pre match fuel begin long before the pre match meal  😃   a discussed in previous post  carbohydrate are the main fuel source involved in gaa  we can store <Number> <Number> in our liver and <Number> <Number> in our muscle a glycogen  but a glucose is constantly being used a a fuel source it is constantly depleting therefore we need to top it up regularly    pre match nutriton begin the day before a game  so if you play sunday at <Number>  you should be topping glycogen store from <Number> saturday  i recommend a carbohydrate source with each meal like cous cous for lunch  potato for dinner and oat for breakfast the following morning  closer to game time  fruit is a great source of cárbohydrate  protein is also essential  a athlete we are constantly in recovery mode for our next session so protein need to be a part of our pre match routine  although it wont be used a fuel it is an important element for muscle repair etc    some donts the day of a game ❌❌❌ ❎ high fat food are harder to break down in the body and may cause gastrointestinal upset so best to avoid large quantity of fat  save them for afterwards when we need to reduce inflammation ❎ high fibre food can also cause gastrointestinal issue and while fibre is a vital part of a healthy diet  it best to avoid large quantity before game ❎ strong flavoured food   some do ✔️✔️✔️ ☑️ nutrient dense food with a cárbohydrate and protein element 👉oats with whey protein  egg and toast  fruit salad with greek yogurt  chicken and pasta  fish and potato ☑️ dont forget about water  hydration is a key pre match ritual hope this help 😃 never change a routine the day of a game  slowly make change in the day leading up to a game 👌 #eatforhealth #eatforperformance #fitlife #prematch #nutrition #fitliving #fitfam #irishfitfam ,92,2,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/56578225_2096774810371670_951250043440445412_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=H9_Aa2drT-0AX8nQf4S&_nc_oc=AQnXrcNbFhIyQXtaHgaQ7dJf_jHj7o2ocEWOokOMo9swBARsTnP4HTLcBCm5yVmnVhXva6mldtlwCg2HFEv2-p2T&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfAbFh0ENaiEhjtR3E2gFn2G7Z55fRnaqDnJlC3oN3Oe_A&oe=63D8BD6E,https://www.instagram.com/p/BwEY_piBbws/,1.80284E+16,,"[{'timestamp': '2019-04-10T11:50:44+0000', 'text': '@teeganmurphyy @brianaconnell  @laura.doyle.10  @maireadvictory  @nikita_cassidy @_aliciaoates_ 🙌', 'username': 'bexohara', 'like_count': 4, 'id': '17878091251331918'}, {'timestamp': '2019-04-10T08:41:39+0000', 'text': 'Nice Shot!', 'username': 'ozgurmankoc', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '18049008040070922'}]",,,2019-04-10,2019,4,2,8:38:32,8
