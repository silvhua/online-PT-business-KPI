What you see:
✅ A girl who loves exercise - possibly even obsessed 
✅ A person who is motivated
✅ A physically strong female
✅ Someone who eats really well
✅ Not a big partier 
✅ Has time to train 6 times a week

What I see:
✅ A rock solid mindset 
✅ Someone who is disciplined 
✅ A physically and mentally strong female
✅ Someone who nourishes and fuels her body
✅ The most extrovert, social butterfly you’ll ever meet - but doesn’t prioritise partying
✅ Commits to training 6 times a week

Mindset - one of the most important elements to any health and fitness journey. Perspective changes based on the person - we all know the glass half empty/half full example.

If you’re eating well and doing physical exercise but not prioritising your mental exercise - I can promise you what you’re doing is not sustainable in the long term!

Creatine is one of the most vastly researched supplements and has been promoted in the fitness industry in the last few years. According to research, supplementation with creatine monohydrate has been shown to increase Skeletal muscle mass, lean body mass and muscle fibre size. Research also suggests past this and it may encourage healthy aging and benefit brain health. 

𝐃𝐨 𝐈 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐞?
Creatine supplementation can be hugely beneficial for athletic performance and studies have also showed it can have an impact on body composition (prolonged creatine ingestion inducing an increase in fat free mass). 

𝐃𝐨 𝐈 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐞?
Nope. 5g daily will suffice. (The idea to saturate the muscle is just to experience benefits sooner).
Increase water consumption when you start taking creatine.

Evidence does suggest post workout is superior to pre workout.

- Bloating - This is due to the muscles absorbing the water with the Creatine. Very common and usually subsides when the muscles are saturated.
- Stomach discomfort - May cause stomach sensitivity like bloating.

6,2023-01-19T18:51:17+0000,"7 things I wish I knew in my early 20s. I dont want you to make the same mistakes I made.

1. Being consistently good is better than being occasionally perfect.

2. The weekend makes up a large part of the week. If you think you’re being good during the week and not making progress - take a look at your weekends.

3. Sleep is one of the most underestimated tools to help you achieve ANY goal. If you’re sleep is shit and you’re sacrificing it ‘to seize the morning’ and train at 6am - you may be doing more harm than good.

4. Water consumption is the simplest way to becoming a healthier version of yourself. Stop looking at fad diets, detox teas, apple cider vinegar and look at your hydration status. Dehydration affects every system in our body and can lead to lack of energy, low mood, injury and brain fog (to mention afew).

5. Human connection, vitamin D and exercise are some of the most under utilised mental health prescriptions. Try increase all of these on the daily to see an instant mood shift 🙏

6. Stop trying to be a people pleaser and learn to say no - you are your own most important asset. 

7. Live every day like it’s your last ❤️ Do what makes you happy!

How are your New Years Resolutions coming along? 

Are you struggling? 

Is it sustainable? 

My clients are thriving 🙌

Why? 
 - Because I make it easy for them ✅

But how?
- Well instead of giving them 7 million tasks in week one. I have a much slower, more sustainable approach! I use healthy habits to help them adjust to a long term lifestyle change. 

❌It’s not pretty. 
❌It’s not fancy. 
❌It doesn’t sell well.

✅ But it works. You see if you commit to the long term, you can do it slower. If you’re only commiting to 6 weeks - you have to change immediately. But we all know nothing changes that quick. Nothing sustainable anyway. It takes time. It takes effort. But we’re here for the long term so who’s rushing? 🤷‍♀️

✅ My ethos is you only have ONE BODY - ONE PLACE to call home! You need to look after it. You need to mind and care for it. 

- If your house was falling apart around you or your car was dangerous to drive you’d pay any amount to fix it. How come when it comes to our body - OUR HOME - an investment is too expensive or not worth it? 🤔

Yay or Nay? 🧐

I put up a poll on my Instagram before Christmas to see who would be training over the holidays and 90% of you said you would. 

Sometimes, we have really high expectations of ourselves that when we don’t meet those expectations - we become disappointed 😔 While having high expectations is not necessarily a bad thing, being realistic is important 🙏

Going on holidays this Christmas I recognised that training was not going to be a priority to me. I said I’d train 2-3 times a week because I love it - not because I HAD to. 

There is NO NECESSITY for you to train during holidays. If you want to - do it! If you don’t - don’t! One thing I will say is 1. Do it for the right reasons - maybe that’s to get back into a routine, or for your mental health - but NOT to ‘burn off calories’

2. Whatever decision you make - own it! Don’t go winging and complaining after 3 weeks off that ‘you wish you did a bit’ or ‘how sore you are’. Get over it and get on with it.

Here’s my TOP TIP - Build your meals around the protein source🙃

My first thought at any meal is what is the protein? And then I build my meal from there! 

People will blame time for their poor food choices but I can assure you, you don’t have to be super organised to make better choices! (The last 2 days I’ve been eating Turkey burgers, microwave rice and microwave cauliflower rice)

When I go shopping I like to have a rough guide done of what I’ll eat during the week so all the options are in my house - that way I’ve no excuses to eat out or make poor food choices! And if you do eat out, there’s NUMEROUS options to align with your goals!

16,2023-01-05T08:36:13+0000,"I think my CrossFit journey has been a little like your weight loss journey and here’s why 👂

I was asked to do my first CrossFit competition late 2018.

I first started to dabble in Crossfit in 2019. 

I would just do random workouts with random exercises and to be fair - it was enough to win competitions at a scaled level.

In 2020, I joined a CrossFit gym and this is where I say my journey began.

I can honestly say the most progress I’ve made was in the last 6 months of 2022. 

Let me tell you why? 

I started a programme that was tailored to my goals. A structured progressive overload programme that was in accordance with my goals.

Ok let me relate this back to your weight loss journey. 

My first year of CrossFit I was essentially pissing in the wind. Random workouts with no structure. But I still made progress. Does that relate to the start of your journey? You were doing it alone but you still lost weight because you made some small changes?

The next year and a half - I programme hopped - I think I did 3 different programmes in the space of 1.5 years with none of them aligning with my goals. Although the process of programme hopping in itself is the problem - not sticking with something long enough to see the results 🫣

The last 6 months I feel like Goldilocks, I’ve got it just right. This programme is geared towards my goals. It allows for progression and I’ve reaped the rewards!

You see this could be you. 

Maybe you’ve had the same journey as me?

Maybe you’ve tried it alone?

You’ve tried many diets or coaches or programmes that didn’t work?

But take it from me - when you find the right one - you’ll never look back 💪",61,8,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/323367005_489444910036524_8236448764833263749_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=mZr86qCkWwwAX-i0Ttl&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfDbk5wHWuzJ-prk8-QVO8B5nCBVn_Emsqn64X_3A-UOiA&oe=63D878B8,https://www.instagram.com/p/CnBul-6IP15/,17942300240367983,,"[{'timestamp': '2023-01-05T09:19:22+0000', 'text': '🤩\U0001faf6🏼', 'username': 'niamhhod', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2023-01-05T09:27:42+0000', 'text': '@niamhhod 😘', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '17986574737743079'}]}, 'id': '17854008641859784'}, {'timestamp': '2023-01-05T08:50:39+0000', 'text': 'What a beast 👏', 'username': 'tori_tucka', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2023-01-05T09:02:36+0000', 'text': '@tori_tucka always the best cheerleader ❤️', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '17970413375011827'}]}, 'id': '17961555584230941'}, {'timestamp': '2023-01-05T08:49:14+0000', 'text': 'Wow.....your body is unreal fit...you look amazing...🥰', 'username': 'karentrayers', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2023-01-05T09:03:15+0000', 'text': '@karentrayers ah thank you Karen!

They feel they have no time to go to the gym because they are too busy. Or they don’t have time to be making seperate dinners for their family.

Thankfully a lot of my clients train from home 3 times a week with minimal equipment. And I NEVER ask them to make seperate dinners.

You see the thing is - you don't actually need hours in the gym to achieve your goals - especially if you're crazy busy. I also encourage women to make better, more simple choices if they are too busy to cook. And instead of scrolling on Social media - I set step targets for them (even if they scroll while they walk). 

You see - it's pretty simple. Try this out and let me know how it goes.

We all lead such busy lifestyles these days. We give time to our families, our friends, and work and we are left with little to no time. 

It's so frustrating because you're trying to be a good friend, mother, daughter, sister, colleague, or employee. But what's left for you? Or maybe there is time? 

I've found that most people usually can find time. Maybe instead of an hour of Netflix we could swap it for a workout? Maybe instead of scrolling we could be walking? Or instead of picking up a takeaway on the way home from work, we could pick up a ready meal in a supermarket? The problem lies in trying to do too much.

To be totally honest, I love both pictures. I’m proud of my body in both pictures. 🙏 

These pictures respresent 2 points in time. The one on the left I was socialising a lot more while the one on the right was sacrificing a lot more. 

Both pictures, I trained. Both pictures I ate well and slept lots. 

The two main differences are: 
1. A lot more structured training programme 
2. A lot less social events 

Some times I’ll be leaner. Other times I’ll retain a little more water. But honestly, I don’t train for aesthetics - I train and eat well for how my body feels. When I train hard and eat nutritiously - my body is energised and thanks me 🙏 i want every woman to feel good no matter what they’re body fat percentage or scale weight shows ❤️

2,2022-12-27T09:57:06+0000,"Yesterday, I mentioned a common problem i see in women trying to drop body fat.

Women lack education and understanding around nutrition which causes serial yo yo dieting. 

To fix this problem, you need more nutrition education on how you can eat the foods you love and still get the results you deserve. 

Here's how it works: 

As a qualified nutritionist, I educate females on how to make good food choices to achieve their goals. I don't focus on short term quick fixes but long term sustainable results. I genuinely believe if you hand someone a diet plan you will only help them so far,  but if you educate them on a balanced lifestyle - this is invaluable.

Are you constantly fad dieting because you're afraid if you're not dieting you will gain weight. You're afraid that if you don't stick to that deficit you'll never be happy in your clothes. 

I feel terrible for you, because you're genuinely trying. You know no different. We've grown up with fad dieting, our mothers  yo yo dieted. It's all we've known - we only know strict calorie deficits and exercise to burn calories 😢 

But I've found the solution to your problems. I believe in education. Have you ever heard the saying “If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.” I want you to understand you CAN ACHIEVE results and ENJOY the food you love 😍

Did you know along with nutrition and accountability calls every week, nutrition guidelines, and calories calculated for you - the training programmes are all tailored to you.

That means if you train from home with limited equipment, if you have an injury, if you play sport, if you’re a beginner or if you’re a seasoned gym goer - I adapt the programme to you! I’m going to be using my Strong and Sassy programme while I’m at home (here’s some of the movements I did last week)

If you’re sick of cookie cutter programmes or asking for changes because youve injuries or adaptations.

November was hectic (my Dad's Anniversary and Birthday, moving house, sorting visas and multiple competitions). It was a bit of a whirlwind. 

I'm looking forward to spending Christmas with friends and family at home ❤🙏 I'm very lucky that work doesn't much feel like work and although I will have some downtime I will be working most of Christmas 🧑‍🎄 

This is my first time home in 3 years, It's definitely different to Christmas in Austrailia, I’ll have a lot more clothes on this Christmas Day 😅 

This year - I’ll be focusing on my little black dress rather than a bikini. Some of my clients are already sending me pictures of their Christmas clothes and are excited to be buying them in sizes smaller or tighter fit 🙏🙌

Anyway I'm going to keep this short as I spend quality time with my family💃 If you're interested in feeling amazing in your clothes as my clients.  DM me 👗",97,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/321066498_1298371037651038_558713184022897735_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=jgrGtJjsGecAX-94Vef&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfDwrQw6Jut8iL-4S3GUIL-kAczI0GttPFN-1Y1Jwm_JRg&oe=63D8AFA2,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cma0S82IAx0/,18021723325428328,,,,

Let me tell you as with EVERYTHING in life - there are pros and cons to everything. 

What I am doing now is LITERALLY my dream job ❤️🔥 And I wouldn’t change it for the world. But nothing good in life comes without sacrifice.

While most people take a trip home and enjoy a month off. I will be working. (I’ll take the holidays off) But my job doesn’t stop ✋ 

Goals require sacrifice. Achievements require sacrifice. Nothing is handed to anyone.

The same goes for fat loss or weight loss.

Effort determines the result! 

So next time you think - someone is ‘so lucky’ - think of what they did to achieve that. No matter what area of life - jobs, fitness, weight loss, relationships - I can assure you - that person has sacrificed something somewhere 🔥",224,10,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319944493_474224254635618_4954826788373541070_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=GKl0J5zr3xcAX_BUXTB&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfB8g4HD3ieO0_UK5G05lk4jsM3vNBpCUOeptqDnH5f4ZQ&oe=63D78CF5,https://www.instagram.com/p/CmLSy_FI6ES/,17937622163398502,,"[{'timestamp': '2022-12-16T07:27:59+0000', 'text': 'Great to have you home🙏❤️', 'username': 'fullbodyworkhouse', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2022-12-16T11:24:49+0000', 'text': '@fullbodyworkhouse see you next week ❤️', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '17961959702169799'}]}, 'id': '17977709728878215'}, {'timestamp': '2022-12-15T12:22:54+0000', 'text': 'Welcome back❤️', 'username': 'kjheery', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2022-12-15T12:42:14+0000', 'text': '@kjheery thank you ❤️', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '17934761906532880'}]}, 'id': '17969097652996055'}, {'timestamp': '2022-12-15T06:22:37+0000', 'text': ""Well said!

Fitness is not just fitness.

Eating healthy food is not just nourishing your body.

The Strong and Sassy programme is continuing to CHANGES LIVES ❤️🔥

You may THINK you just need a gym.

You may THINK you just need a diet plan.

What you really need is support and accountability 🙏

Emily started this programme with her confidence levels at an all time low. She wasn’t happy in how she looked or felt 🥹

Now 9 months later -
✅ She has completed true grit
✅ Lost 13.5kg
✅ Become the STRONGEST version of herself
✅ Gained confidence

18,2022-12-06T18:51:18+0000,"Christmas is well and truely on its way. While this is an exciting time and a time where people are socialising more and enjoying themselves more. I’ve actually found it can be a hugely anxious time for people too.🥹

I’ve witnessed women who are hugely self conscious and unhappy in their body struggle to pick an outfit for a Christmas dinner.

I’ve seen women change about 10 times before throwing on the baggiest option they can find.

Up until this year - that was Teresa. Teresa hid behind bigger clothes in an effort to feel better.

I remember once upon a time - myself - holding onto clothes ‘that would fit again’.

Ladies this has to stop 🛑 

I am telling you now - it’s not about weight loss. It’s not about a clothes size. It’s not about number on the weighing scales.

It’s about feeling good internally.

It’s about having a balanced lifestyle. Nourishing your body but never feeling guilty about food. It’s about exercising because you enjoy it. Not using it as punishment. ❌

Until you can find that internal happiness - it doesn’t matter what diet you’re doing, what calories you’re eating, what exercise you’re doing - you won’t be comfortable and confident.

But the good news is - I have the solution🙋‍♀️

My Strong and Sassy programme was designed specifically to help women become the healthiest, happiest and most confident versions of themselves.

If you want to become like Sarah - who is now ROCKING tight, figure hugging clothes. Or Jennifer who is wearing bikinis and crop tops.

20,2022-12-01T19:09:04+0000,"Want to get fitter, stronger, leaner? 🧐

1. Nutrition is the most important element to these goals - are you eating enough protein? Are you eating healthy but not tracking calories? Are you blowing calories mindlessly at weekends? All questions that you should ask yourself when having a goal!

2. Random classes = random results. Follow a progressive overload programme and watch the results flow in

3. One of the most underrated performance tools - sleep! Stop neglecting it - start treating it as important as nutrition and even MORE important than exercise!

To say I’m proud would be an understatement here and be prepared for a long post 😂

Going into my first individual event my expectations were to keep within the Top 6. So winning this event was truely special 🥰

With 3 event wins, I can honestly say my proudest moment was 3rd in the last event 😂 I went to one of the darkest places I’ve ever been in my training and I would not have got through it without my ultimate cheer squad @lillie704 @lift__with__laura @misssophieelizabeth @col_ryaner @renners9 @o_boyce 

I feel so thankful and grateful to be ABLE to push my body to these limits and how fun is it doing it with the best crew. Even more special was podiuming with @brian_fannon 🙌🙏

As always with every competition, there’s things to learn and FUCK these girls are STRONG 💪 So there’s still lots to be done 🙏

Thank you to @battleofbenton for an incredible event. Ran impeccably from start to finish. 

And the biggest thank you to @jaydenazza @crossfitbotany who had me in this condition going into this competition. The future is looking bright 💃

That’s it for the competitions for 2022 (never again will I do 3 in a row 😂).

Does that mean you shouldn’t try? Absolutely not!

Hear me out 👂

Travel is not easy. You’ve to travel to an airport. Have a passport to board. Pack all your clothes and items you’ll need. Board a plane. Travel hours depending on where you go. Set up in another part of the world. Find new places and set yourself up.

But you don’t NOT do it. It has a few requirements and pre requisites but if you want it - you’ll tick all of the boxes. 

Age is like the distance to the destination. Some flights take longer, some countries are further away. But that DOES not mean we can’t make it to our destination! 

What makes the journey easier? 
- Nutrition Habits that create long term sustainable change - rather than quick fix 6 week challenges (comparing a first class Quantas flight to a RyanAir flight here incase you missed it)
- Resistance based training that supports healthy hormones, bone mass density and reducing muscle mass decrease (airbus a380 versus a Boeing 737)
- Accountability and support. (We all know how good an attentive cabin crew is 🙏)
- Yes there are more considerations to consider here but that’s the beauty of having a coach. You can discuss these topics and work on them.

- I’ve helped 100s of women achieve their goals all ages. All shapes and sizes. Nothing is a ‘too difficult’.

Yet you neglect it.

You don’t prioritise it.

Everything else.

You’d be gone! 

Your kids, husband, partner, employer, friends would be without their mother, wife, partner, employee and friend.

And that’s ok! 

Firstly, we need to understand some biology here. Women have approximately DOUBLE the amount of essential body fat that a man has. What does essential mean? We need it. It’s necessary for our overall health. 

Secondly, understand when a female has visible abs - they are usually on the threshold of that healthy/unhealthy body fat percentage. 
If they are super active or athletes and consuming adequate calories and have a higher lean muscle mass - often they’re body fat percentage is healthy for their level. On the other hand, someone who has <18% Body Fat from extreme dieting with low lean muscle mass is mostly considered an unhealthy body composition.

Lastly and MOST importantly, the main reason why most women will never have visible abs is because they are simply not willing to make the sacrifices to achieve them. And that’s PERFECTLY alright. In a lot of instances women would have to give up social occassions, wine & chocolate. And have to engage in a lot more activity than their time schedules allow! 🙏

So if you have that as a goal - have a little think about the above points.

Young Amanda, started learning more and with more knowledge came more power 😍 Knowledge helped improve my nutrition choices! All of a sudden, with better nutrition choices, I’m feeling more energetic, I’m not constantly sick, I’m starting to gain a little muscle and I’m sleeping better 🥰

Fast forward - 7 years later - and you have the Coach Mc Loone you see today. But that person did not always exsist. You see through knowledge I gained power. I now KNOW how to nourish my body, how to become strong, how to feel energised.

Let me give you an example. Comparing my 24 hours with a 40 year old working mother of 4 is just INCOMPARABLE!!!!

It’s not that the 40 year old mother of 4 doesn’t WANT to look after her health and fitness (I literally have women with these credentials doing the Strong and Sassy Programme).

I have the luxury of working from home. Because of time differences with clients - the bulk of my work is done mornings and evenings so my free time is during the day. I’ve no kids. No mortgages. Life is EASIER for me! So my 24 hours are very different to my clients.

Like Mandi who is a mother of 5 and runs her own business. She prioritises her workouts when her kids are gone to school💃

Or Elaine who is a doctor - has to get her workouts done on her lunch break 💪

Jacqui is doing tennis as her exercise - she gets to socialise and exercise 🎾 

Gillian who doesn’t want to make different meals for her family - controls portions and adds extra veg.

Lucy who is commuting 2hours a day - has her meals and snacks prepared!

I could lie to you and tell you the Strong and Sassy programme is the best strength programme around. But truth is all programmes can work - if you can be consistent with them. How can we stay consistent with them?

I spoke with a friend yesterday who used to do classes in the gym and has recently started an online programme. She said ‘it actually keeps her more accountable- because if she misses a day of the programme - it messes up the rest of her programme. Plus she has someone checking in with her each week’. The accountability of her programme is MAKING her be more consistent. With classes, if she missed a day - no one checked in to see why? It didn’t have an impact on the rest of her programme, she just picked up where she left off?

Online programmes allow you to have more flexibility and freedom. But also, regular check ins mean you’ve always someone holding you accountable.

As a woman, one of the greatest signs of health is a regular, monthly cycle. 🙏❤️

I know it’s a nuisance. I know it can be painful. I know it can cause us to be a bottomless pit 🐷 (p.s out BMR actually increases the week before our period - so we actually NEED extra calories 😍)

But if overall health is your goal - a regular monthly cycle is the pinnacle of health. If for some reason, you’re not getting a monthly cycle (unknown reason) - please reach out to your doctor.

I’m particularly happy to see mine this time around. Why?

Because mine arrived 7 days LATE! We knew we weren’t expecting any baby Boyce’s- I knew EXACTLY why my period was late and I actually anticipated it.

I’m SUPER in tune with my body. I know what’ll put it out of whack. I know that travel causes disruptions to my cycle. I know that alcohol has an effect on it and I know the impact stress has on my body too.

As I’ve harped on about the last few weeks have been super stressful for me. You could join the dots with all spots on my neck and chest and I knew something had to give.

Do NOT underestimate the affect of stress on your body. It affects our health in more ways than people could even imagine. Accumulation of stress can lead to much greater health risks than a delayed period - so do something about it today ❤️🙏

If you don’t fail. Are you even really trying? 🤔

When it comes to strength training and a structured programme we work a lot of percentages. Some days the weights feel great - and like you could actually add a little extra. Other days 10kg feels like 100 😬🥹

When you’ve been strength training for as long as I have pbs don’t come that often either. (If you’re in the shiny new year of strength training and still hitting pbs all the time - enjoy this 😂)

Failing is part of life - if we fail - at least we know we tried. The thing about failing is though. At SOME point - you will succeed. If you KEEP CONSISTENT and follow a plan - you WILL achieve that number or target or goal.

The same goes for a diet! With nutrition, even if you’ve failed 100 times - you’ve can STILL achieve that goal.

Lecturer 

Hazel is super active. She actually just completed an Iron Man at the weekend 💪

There were 3 main reason Hazel wanted to join the Strong and Sassy programme

1. Get a home based strength programme to accomodate her training goals

2. Work on her nutrition - she’s always been active but knows she needs to work more on her nutrition (not just for weight loss but also to match her activity)

3. As she’s getting older, she wants to support her overall health. Prepare her body as best as possible for the next stage of her life 🙏

She’s already reaping the rewards as she completed her Ironman at the weekend.

I’m so proud of this lady and the commitment she makes even with a super busy schedule 🔥

16,2022-11-07T18:47:44+0000,"Moving house has been listed as one of the most stressful events in your life. Up there with loss of a loved one and divorce.

Unfortunately, I’ve experienced 2 of the 3.

I can honestly say the strain it puts on your physical and mental health is difficult but the most notable stress was the one I experienced with Owen. 

I was moody, complaining constantly and actually quite aggressive. But thankfully, it was short term and I’m back to my normal happy, bubbly self 🙏

This reminded me of a client (a couple of them actually) who was constantly agitated and barking at her partner. The poor fella couldn’t do anything right. 

Why? Why was she constantly cranky to her partner? We soon realised two things that were causing these mood disturbances.
1. She was on crazy low calories - constantly hungry and lacking in energy (anyone who has been HANGRY understands 🙈)
2. She was desperately unhappy in how she viewed herself. This unhappiness in herself projected into her moody outbursts and they were becoming too frequent.

She was GENUINELY worried these feelings were going to have a long term impact on her relationship.

So what did we do?
1. The first one was easy - increasing calories to a normal level while still allowing her to achieve her goals. Her energy levels sky rocketed and her mood instantly improved.
2. Working on self confidence and self esteem was a little trickier. We started to focus on her health from an internal perspective and not just what her body looked like on the outside. We started to do resistance based training and she started to appreciate what her body could do instead of just ‘burning calories’.

Within weeks, her mood improved dramatically, and the cranky outbursts declined steadily. She is now happier in herself than ever before and her partner is also reaping the rewards!!!

Sound familiar? You’re not alone! But you CAN change - with the right guidance and support anything is possible 🙏",97,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/314492045_688037352667917_8287893107491535563_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=IcFDNYwpln4AX-9Bbos&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfAVOQvzESioWZbmbfb5rq8engyjwK-kQGARme6HFcQWKQ&oe=63D842B1,https://www.instagram.com/p/Ckq5rKABIIZ/,18188865568225001,,,,
17,2022-11-06T19:53:46+0000,"Let’s talk mindset 🤯

I stand out of my comfort zone pretty regularly. But twice this year, I stood out of my comfort zone big time.

First, was a novice Weightlifitng competition. Second, a half marathon. 

Why take on these challenges?

Because guess what - it’s not your body that’s saying no. It’s your mind. Your body is capable of a lot more than you think.

It’s not easy going to competitions knowing you won’t win. It’s not easy being 20kg behind other peoples lifts. It’s not easy running 21km. 

But it helps you learn. It builds character. Everytime you step outside that comfort zone you build a little more resilience, a little more confidence. 

I spoke to a client last week and she talked about how increasing calories was mentally challenging. I get it I do, comfort zones are easier.

It’s easy to continue training and exercising while ignoring the biggest problem that’s not allowing you achieve your goals (nutrition 🙈). It’s easy to do 6 week challenges every quarter - lose weight and regain it because you couldn’t sustain it.

What’s not easy? 
Committing to a 6 month programme to improve your habits and make LONG TERM sustainable change.

Quite often people think you need to do more to achieve your goals. And in a lot of cases that is true - more exercise, more water, better nutrition. But for some actually less is more. 
.
.
Everyone has their problem areas. 

👉Some people nail nutrition and exercise and can’t understand why they can’t lose weight - while their bodies are in chronic sleep deprivation 🤦‍♀️ 

👉Others weigh in the week before their period and can’t understand why their weight fluctuates. 

👉Others would rather take a supplement than eat real food 🙈

👉 No ice baths will not mask the fact that you’ve been boozing Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
.
.
These are some of the elements to think about when it comes to your goals - in no particular order 👊

Nutrition and exercise are not the only 2 elements you can control. If you have those nailed why not look at other areas? 🤔

✅ Works in a different country to the one she lives in

✅ Kids with autism

Have you been on the fence for awhile and still not sure if online coaching is for you?

Do any of these scenarios sound familiar?🤔🤔🤔

👉 You’ve been eating really healthy Monday to Friday - weekend comes and all hell breaks loose. Chocolate, wine, crisps, chips - everything! 🥹

👉 You’ve LITERALLY tried EVERYTHING. Every diet. Every exercise known to man and NOTHING WORKS 😭

👉 You’re a working mother and gym class times don’t suit your busy schedule. 🤯

👉 You’re hiding in clothes that are oversized and baggy but you secretly keep the smaller clothes that used to fit you - just incase! 😢

👉 You avoid photos being taken of you or hide behind people because you’re embarrassed or ashamed 😔

👉 You get ready to go out for dinner with your partner and try on everything in your wardrobe - and settle for the jeans and top because nothing feels comfortable 😦

👉 You’re exercising relentlessly but never achieving the physique you’re aspiring to. 

I know there are people out there who not only relate to one of the above but maybe even multiple 😭 And it’s not for the lack of trying. You feel like you’ve been trying your whole life and nothing ever works.

What if I told you - I have the solution! To every single one of the above scenarios? 😱

Because I do! 

And I know this because I have helped women overcome every single one of the above situations. 

🔥 Look at Simone (mother) - who completed ALL of her training from home. 

🔥 Check out Ciara (nurse) - who is finally seeing progress in the gym with her own personalised programme.

🔥 Teresa (mother) - who is the fittest she’s been in years and feeling incredible in a dress

🔥 Elaine (doctor) - who ran 10km for the first time.

🔥 Jennifer (nurse) - who has finally found the right nutrition balance and no longer worries about scale weight.

I’ll be honest, I learned ALOT. Although we finished in an INCREDIBLE fourth position with all top 5 finishes and I’m BEYOND proud of our efforts - My focus will be on my weaknesses 🏋️‍♀️ 

I’ve been strength training for 10 years and football fitness means I have a decent cardio background. But I’ve only been doing CrossFit for 2.5 years so the skills side of it is still a major weakness. My gymnastics capacity and barbell cycling is NOT where I want it to be.

From my experience, most women are control freaks (I’m one too 🙊😂). We think we need to know everything. We are strong independent women afraid to rely on others for help ☹️

We think we should ‘know what to do’ in all areas of life. But from my experience - those who delegate work to other people in different areas of their life - often have the most success.

Why?
Because it’s one less thing for YOU to do.

Having a coach to help you with your health and fitness is actually a shortcut! 

Why? Because the expertise, accountability and the right plan allows you to HAVE MORE TIME! 

Not only that - you’re not WASTING your time trailing methods that may or may not work for you!

I’ll give you an example. 
Were you that slim 20 year old that could eat whatever she wanted without ever gaining weight. So you ate takeaways and never exercised? Your 40 year old self may not feel the same way. 

I try to educate to my clients that every action you take has a consequence. You may not be able to see it in the short term, but long term your body is thanking you 🙏❤️

Another example - last week I was talking to my clients about menopause. Now majority of my clients are a long way away from menopause - so why talk to them about it?
Every action they choose between now and then can have an impact on their symptoms. For example - if you start resistance training in your 20s - your menopausal body will thank you 🙏 

Every action has a consequence. If you constantly rely on short term gratification- there will be long term consequences.

Not going to lie - this is a trigger for me. I absolutely HATE the term. I hate it a little bit less than ‘I don’t want to get bulky’ 😂

Anyway here’s what you need to do to ‘tone up’

1. Understand what it is you’re saying 😂 you want to change your body composition which is reducing your body fat mass and increasing your lean muscle mass. 

2. Lift weights - a body building style progressive overload programme is best for this if aesthetic goals are what you’re looking for

3. Control your food intake - easiest achieved by a calorie deficit

4. Be consistent - it doesn’t happen overnight so you may aswell enjoy the process.

You’re a daughter, an employee, a friend, maybe a sister or a mother…

The ONLY way you can become the best version of you is by attending to your own oxygen mask first.

Running yourself into the ground is the exact opposite–and it’s taking you further away from being that person. 

Self-Care is a selfless act. 

When YOU are at your best, in shape, full of energy and confidence… you can serve everyone around you at the highest level and feel AMAZING doing it. 

People around you will recognize your work and follow your example. 

When you aren’t at your best, you simply can’t do that. It’s impossible.

Just ask my client Teresa who has found her ‘me time’ and continues to find it every week. She trains from home in the morning and has just completed a half marathon and done breathwork for the first time in her life.

Or my clients who do shift work. And even though it’s difficult to find a good routine - they manage to smash it every week. 

Or what about Elaine who moved continent, works abroad, has 2 kids with special needs AND IS A DOCTOR!

I had two thoughts -
1. My picky eating habits have come a long way in the last 10 years 
2. I’m so grateful to eat food with 0 guilt, no working off calories or depriving myself of the foods I love.

When I wanted to become a nutritionist - my family were astounded - ‘but you don’t eat anything’ . I had a diet full of beige foods and very little protein. They were right 😂 but I loved science and I wanted to understand how nutrition affects the body.

The pickiness was something that weaned it’s way out as I aged and was more open to food suggestions.

The guilt and binging was a whole different kettle of fish…

For anyone who knows my background, you’ll know I played Gaelic football almost my whole life. 

I know 29 is NOT old. I’m well aware of this. But when you’re competing against people who started in their early teens it’s pretty late to the party.

I have clients who never consistently exercised until 40.

I have clients who only started becoming knowledgeable on nutrition at 50.

You see the thing is. 

We tell ourselves a story in our head.

I’ll wait until Monday.

I’ll wait until next month.

I’ll start in the New Year.

It’s easy to say we’ll start - when we’re ready. Or until we have time to commit to it.

You see the thing is. We’re actually not guaranteed time. My Dad died at 55. Him dying at such a young age, made me truely value time! 

If you want something, you have to start now. Not when you’re ready or when the perfect circumstances arise. You have to be willing to start now.

I’ve 3 competitions coming up over the next few months and I am BUZZING! You see I decided I want to become the healthiest, fittest and strongest version of myself and that’s the commitment I’ve made to myself.

6,2022-10-17T18:40:11+0000,"Let’s talk sacrifice.

There’s no doubt about it. In order to achieve our goals - we need to make sacrifice.

I do believe however, our sacrifices have to be less extreme and a lot more sustainable.
For example: People who embark on diets of no sugar, no carbs and no alcohol would be much better off just reducing the frequency and quantity of these foods or drinks in their diet.

My client Jennifer has dramatically reduced her alcohol consumption. She’s not taking extreme measures or going off it forever but she doesn’t prioritise it anymore.

Personally, I have a lot of competitions coming up over the next few weeks so I will definitely have to make sacrifices. Socialising takes a back seat during these busy periods.

Sacrifice is inevitable. But what you sacrifice is up to you. Stop with the extremes of 0 or 100%.

8,2022-10-14T09:24:55+0000,"Successful testing week ✅

The last 4 months I have not been focusing on strength so I wasn’t expecting any significant strength gains. And that’s ok, my training is periodised and I have other fish to fry so goals change.

The reason this testing week was so successful was I’ve been hugely focusing on technique and being pain free 🙌

For me personally, this is key. It’s all well and good clocking up big numbers but if your technique sucks - it will catch up on you in one way or another.

Personal wins for me this week:

✅ My beautiful snatch 🥰 Because I am FINALLY squat snatching my numbers actually went up to but honestly if my numbers remained the same and I improved my technique I would have been happy.

✅ I’m also finally squat cleaning - my body is still in a little bit of shock (if you’re a power clean person you’ll know what I mean) but slowly but surely I’m getting more confident and comfortable under that bar.

✅ PB Split Jerk - again due to technique improvement 🙌

✅ Shoulder Pressing - pain free. For a LONG time I’ve had pain while shoulder pressing and it made me shy away from the movement. How good is it to move a weight without pain 🙏

✅ Gymnastics - my obvious downfall when it comes to CF but with INCREDIBLE guidance and coaching - this weakness is starting to become much better. And again, doing it with a structured programme has allowed for pain free movement.

I’ve realised with the right programme and mentoring anything is possible. 

So please no matter what your goals are there is a roadmap for you to achieve them. You may not have found it in the past, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find it in the future. Remember your goals. Remember not everyone’s are the same and what works for someone else - may not work for you.

Maybe if I had someone keeping me accountable - Amanda to achieve x, you need to do extra shooting drills 3 times a week. Honestly, I think I would have done it! Or if I had some encouragement to try and achieve it!

Maybe all you’re missing is that encouragement to go and achieve your health and fitness goals. Maybe you need someone to be accountable to you - to do the work for you.  You need to eat x,y & z and train Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

There’s no criteria to becoming a Strong and Sassy female. There’s no age limit or fitness level required.

What I do expect - 
🔥 Commitment
🔥 To show up 
🔥 Enjoy the person you are about to become

✨Aoibheann has been with me for quite awhile. She originally started during lockdown and had fantastic physical results. She came back to me recently to strike a balance between socialising and commiting to her health and fitness. Having turned 30 at the weekend - she is feeling the best

✨ Simone is a working momma who initially signed up for 6 months but ended up staying a year 😍 She honestly had every excuse to NOT prioritise herself but she didn’t let the excuses get in her way. 8kg later - she’s the healthiest fittest version of herself and everyone is noticing.

✨ Teresa had been consistently training before coming to me. Once she had that nailed she wanted to dial in on her nutrition. While she worked immensely hard on her nutrition we also educated her on the importance of sleep and stress management and her coffee intake DRAMATICALLY decreased.

✨ Laura (teacher) wanted to find a balance and get back into a good exercise regime. Not only did she lose weight on the scales but her confidence grew exponentially.

These are just the physical results you can achieve from doing my Strong and Sassy programme.

Teresa had sent me this photo -beaming from ear to ear with pride.

She had just completed a half marathon in 2hours 18mins.

Let me tell you a little bit about Teresa’s journey.

Firstly, and probably most importantly - she thought Online Coaching was a scam 😅

She didn’t know what she had signed up to with her initial call with Brian but she went for it anyway 🙈

After realising it wasn’t a scam and after a great consultation call - she actually realised this was the perfect programme for her lifestyle (she’s a working mother).

She initially signed up to 12 weeks and had an initial goal of running a 10km.

6 months later - she has signed up for ANOTHER 3 Months AND completed a half marathon.

This isn’t a fluke.

This is what you get when you surround yourself with a great like minded community and a coach who supports and educated you.

Teresa now describes the programme as ‘her time’ and the best investment she’s ever made in herself.

I put up a question box asking ‘why people like following me’ and a lovely lady responded ‘Confident, go getter’.

Wow 🤩 

That is EXACTLY how I’d like to be described.

This absolutely warmed my heart because honestly that has not always been the case.

When I was younger I conformed to societal norms. I REALLY REALLY wanted to be liked. I craved attention so badly. To the naked eye - I probably appeared Uber confident. I was loud and always trying to be the centre of attention. 

I defined my worth on how many friends I had. How much money I had. Having the latest brands and caking my face in make up. I genuinely believed ‘that is what confident is’.

But I couldn’t have been more wrong.

I was young and immature. 

I don’t regret it. Because I truely believe these things mould you into the person you become.

I now realise confidence is not walking into a room expecting and hoping people will like me. Confidence is walking into a room and not caring if they do!

Confidence is wearing a bikini or dress at any time of the year and not worrying about what anyone else thinks.

Confidence is belief in yourself and your own abilities but never belittling someone else for your gain.

Confidence is NOT something you’re born with. Confidence is something you have to work on -  day in day out. It’s something you have to talk to yourself about. Something that needs reassurance from time to time. 

But confidence will make you happier than any scale weight, any dress size or any weight lifted.

1. My lean muscle mass means that my BMR is higher. More muscle = more calories

2. Resistance training - lifting weights supports an increased BMR. Lifting weights does not need to be in a gym - remember half my clients train from home and achieve incredible results.

3. I’ve been training at a high level - both cardio and strength for 10+ years - time frame matters

4. The type of food I consume - NOT JUST CALORIES - I support a balanced lifestyle but most of my nutrition comes from wholefoods

5. I sleep 7.5-8 hours a night

6. Alcohol is not a priority. It doesn’t mean I don’t drink. It means I’d rather train on a Saturday morning than drink on a Friday night.

Your goals are different to your friends.

Everyone in this picture has different goals.

See what I’m getting at…

So why would we all do the same thing 🤔

This is something that I get in my dms or with clients regularly -
‘But my friend Mary did paleo and she lost a stone in a month’

Yes Sarah - but you’re 5 years older than her, have 2 kids more than her and she has been training for 10 years’

Truth is - even if Sarah didn’t have 2 kids, was 5 years younger and trained for 10 years she may STILL never get the same results as Mary 🤷‍♀️

Because EVERYONE is different 😣

I’m sorry if that’s not the answer you wanted to hear but it’s the truth 🙈

So next time - you try to compare - please don’t!

Every single person I deal with has different goals and how I coach them varies from person to person.

Sometimes I have clients who come to me thinking they need to dial in on their nutrition - when they actually need to stress less and sleep more 💤

Other ladies think they need to be training 7 days a week when they actually need to do less and walk more.

Don’t settle for cookie cutter. 

Don’t settle for anything less than what you want and need.

She has been training on and off for years. Her main goal was to get into a good routine and be accountable. She was looking for a long term sustainable change - without restriction. 

Before we started working together Helen did programmes and trained - but as soon as she had a bad week or didn’t see the scales moving - she gave up. She found herself unhappy in her clothes and she was sick of stopping and starting. 

She hesitated in starting because of pride ‘She thought she could and should do it alone’. And if she's honest, she thought ‘I know what to do’. But she realised she needed direction, accountability and a community - which drove her to take action.
(P.s Helen is a trainer and has a background in Health promotion - but even coaches need coaches)

'I knew others who did Amanda’s programme and I knew it had a personal approach' ‘I knew there was a community environment to it and I liked that’

For those of you who don’t already know, I lost my Dad to pancreatic cancer.

I can tell you right now - it was without a doubt one of the hardest times in my entire life. 

I can tell you another thing - one of the biggest things that got me through it was training! 

I would hope it’s obvious that I was not motivated to eat healthy when my Dad was terminally ill. The easy option was to eat takeaways - but instead I brought my tupperware to Tullamore hospital! I also think it’s obvious that when he eventually passed away - I wasn’t waking up BUZZING to get to the gym.

But I still went…

I still showed up.

Even when my Dad was dying. Even when he died. I SHOWED up! I didn’t eat rubbish or crap or convenience! 

Why? 
- Because I said I would. I am committed to myself - not only when it’s easy and I’m positive and I’m motivated. I’m committed to my health even more on the tough days - on the days I barely feel like getting out of bed. 

And I will continue to commit to myself. I will continue to show up for myself.

5am alarm clock…

Whether I’m doing coaching calls or the odd outdoor training session, my 5am alarm is a constant. I’m without a doubt a morning lark and get all my most productive work done in the morning! 

I’ll usually get a little walk in mid morning or afternoon. My job is actually quite sedentary but my 10,000 steps is a non negotiable.

I train either early afternoon or 4pm. I train  days - sometimes twice a day. 
(P.s for anyone thinking you need to do this it is ABSOLUTELY UNNECESSARY unless you have a sporting goal - which I do)

My bedtime is 8.30pm sharp and I honestly think I have the sleep requirements of a newborn baby 😂

I went to a life coach a few years ago and he asked me my dream job. I couldn’t give him an answer but I could say this -
✅ choose my working hours 
✅ have my own business
✅ help as many people as possible in the world
✅ be an educator 

Turns out I’ve pretty much nailed that job down 😂 

This lifestyle works for me. I’m so happy that I have this career and it allows me to train the way I would like to also. But for majority of people - training that much is unnecessary and honestly, does not fit into many people’s time schedule.

Be smarter and wiser with your time. So find what works for you and your lifestyle. And whatever it is - make sure it’s sustainable 💪👊

I’m super tired after the four hour drive home today.

Easy to let excuses slip in for not having my food prepared or not train tomorrow.

But see the thing is - my health and fitness is a priority to me. I could have EASILY opted for Uber Eats but having good nutritious food in my fridge is essential for me. 

I’ll be in bed super early so training doesn’t suffer also. Again, training is a priority. I don’t allow excuses especially not choices I’ve made myself 👊

21,2022-09-29T19:10:12+0000,"It’s hard to believe that once upon a time I couldn’t do chin ups.

Because guess what - that’s the reality.

Once upon a time, I was EXACTLY where you are now. 

I couldn’t do an inverted row - let alone a chin up - and that was when I was training to be a Personal trainer 🫣

So what changed? 🤔
✨I started training consistently 
✨I designed a progressive overload programme (I’ve recently delegated my programming and coaching to others)
✨I started eating to fuel my body 
✨I showed up - even when I didn’t want to

And 10 years later - here we are. Not just doing chin ups but repping an extra 20kg to Bodyweight (which isn’t light btw 😅)

So why are you struggling so much to see progress?

Ok ask yourself -
☄️ Are you just doing random classes that achieve random results? Or are you doing a programme that works TOWARDS your goal? 
🤓P.s Doing chin ups once a week is NOT enough

☄️ Do you even have a goal?

☄️ Are you eating enough to fuel performance? 

☄️ Are you eating the correct types of foods?
🤓P.s contrary to what every other PT on the internet says this MOST CERTAINLY does matter

☄️ And finally and most importantly - Are you showing up?

You could have the best programme in the world, a million dollar nutrition coach and if you’re not applying it - you’re going NOWHERE!

⚡️HOW do I do a pull up?

⚡️HOW do I get stronger? 

So I’m about to let the cat out of the bag.

All of your goals can be achieved - if you just do ONE thing - BE CONSISTENT! 

I have been strength training for 10 years. That’s why I can do a pull up with ease. Not because of a programme or any gym. Because for 10 years I showed up. 

I have been taking my nutrition serious for a similar amount of time. So when someone comes to me looking for quick fix, or expecting miracles in a few months - that is my response.

You see consistency trumps EVERY diet or programme on the planet. 

So instead of trying to follow the next trend - why not show up - every week - no excuses, no complaints! 

If you find this difficult (like MANY people do) invest in some accountability, invest in someone who will HELP you when things get tough (because they will), invest in someone who pushes you on the days you don’t want to show up (because it will happen).

I wanted to give it more time…

I hoped and wished and prayed it would work for me…

But time and time again, I realised I was not achieving the results I wanted.

I’m a competitive athlete. Programme, coaching, nutrition, sleep, hydration and environment all have to be aligned for me to make progress. For the last few months, I was staying in an environment that I was comfortable in. I wasn’t seeing results and I wasn’t making progress. 

BUT it was all a choice. I was CHOOSING to stay the same. I was CHOOSING to not make progress – because I was CHOOSING to stay in the same environment. 

Have you ever been in that situation? 

💫 Maybe you’ve been with a coach for so long that you’re no longer getting the service you initially received. 

💫 Maybe you’ve been in a cycle of doing 6 week challenges with people – you don’t know how to do anything long term.

💫Maybe you’ve been with the same gym for years and you’re no longer pushed.

💫 Maybe you’ve been blaming your husband and kids for your lack of time? 

💫 Maybe you’ve used the excuse of - ‘I can’t or I’ll never be…’

3,2022-09-23T20:45:08+0000,"Yesterday, I mentioned a common problem I see in women trying to become bikini confident. 

Women lack education and understanding around nutrition which causes serial yo yo dieting. 

To fix this problem, you need more nutrition education on how you can eat the foods you love and still get the results you deserve. 

Here's how it works: 

As a qualified nutritionist, I educate females on how to make good food choices to achieve their goals. I don't focus on short term quick fixes but long term sustainable results. I genuinely believe if you hand someone a diet plan you will only help them so far,  but if you educate them on a balanced lifestyle - this is invaluable.

Gemma has been active for years - she’s done lots of programmes and worked with PTs. 

Before we started working together Gemma would exercise and work with PTs but she never really saw any ‘gains’.

She hesitated in starting because ‘She wanted to weigh up all the options - financially - would it be worth it’. ‘She also had a fear of failure’. Although after her initial call, a plan was laid out and she felt super confident! 

'In terms of cost, it is definitely the best money I’ve ever spent and I’ve done lots of PTs over the years - they were all lovely but they weren’t what I needed’

Fast forward 6 months later and she fits into her work pants much easier. She has found it great in terms of her ‘own emotional well-being and her form’

You see the thing is - you don't actually need hours in the gym to achieve your goals - especially if you're crazy busy. I also encourage women to make better choices if they are too busy to cook.

I've found that most people usually can find time. Maybe instead of an hour of Netflix we could swap it for a workout? Maybe instead of scrolling we could be walking? Or instead of picking up a takeaway on the way home from work, we could pick up a ready meal in a supermarket? The problem lies in trying to do too much.

Nicole has been doing CrossFit consistently for years but always felt her results didn’t reflect the work she was putting in. She was beginning to put off social occassions and she was at an all time low confidence wise!

Before we started working together Nicole used scales as her only measure of progress - but as soon as she had a bad week or didn’t see the scales moving - she gave up.

She hesitated in starting because ‘She had done programmes and worked with coaches before’ But she never achieved that mindset shift 🤷‍♀️ But she was desperate so took a chance - and she has kept everything up! 

‘I feel like I’m a completely different person and it sounds so cliche - but it was worth it in the end and I feel amazing now’

10,2022-09-20T07:37:55+0000,"🚀 How I became stronger, happier and more confident and how you can too. 

❌When I started in the fitness industry I was a little lost. I was focused on how I looked. I was obsessed with having abs. I only ate ‘clean’ food mid week which led to weekend binges. My relationship with nutrition and fitness definitely was not a healthy one. 

🚨I wasn’t happy. Not in my body. Not in my mind. I genuinely couldn’t imagine continuing my life with this level of restriction and I began to resent the gym 😢 I was tired and cranky and was constantly sick. I distinctly remember a time in final year college where I could not get rid of bronchitis - I was zapped constantly and I lost my place on the college football team! 

✅ Then I stopped focusing so much on HOW I looked. I stopped looking for abs every time I walked by the mirror. I started to appreciate resistance training and I began focusing on how much stronger I was becoming. My goals changed. Performance based goals replaced the quest for abs and I found my love for exercise again. I found a balanced approach to nutrition. I still eat very healthy and nutritious but I no longer restrict myself. 

🔥 I no longer focus on HOW I look but WHAT my body can do. I wear bikinis now without dieting to get in them. I’m stronger and fitter than I’ve ever been and clothes sizes no longer dictate my life. I’m happier and healthier. I love the skin I’m in ❤ Looking back on these pictures actually makes me incredibly sad. I see someone totally different to the person I’ve become! 🙏

- Simone’s (busy mum) habits are now as engrained as brushing her teeth

- Emily (new mum) lost 14kg and in her words ‘is in the best shape of her life’ 

- Michelle (busy professional) lost NOTHING on the scales but look at the change to her shape

I'm looking for a few specific things from my ladies. So if you: 

 🔥Are committed to finally changing your habits.
🔥Are able to train 3 times a week
🔥 Consider yourself to be coachable
🔥 And are ready to get pushed out of your comfort zone. 

Then just comment below with the words 'I'M IN' and I'll be choosing people today.

Being fit is hugely important to me. But fitness is pretty all rounded. I don’t just want to be able to lift weights and be out of breath walking up stairs.

One of the main reasons I love CrossFit is because it incorporates so many elements of fitness. I feel proud to have a body weight and a half back squat but also a 7.42 2km Row.

I set myself this challenge of completing a half marathon in sub 2 hours. With 13 runs in the bag over the last 2 months - it hit my target 🎯 

Thank you so much for all the well wishes and to everyone who donated to ‘Australian Cancer Research Foundation’.

One thing I didn’t mention on this video and it’ll be the thing you don’t want to hear 🙊🥴 Time and patience!!!!

Females tend to have a much lower muscle mass and higher fat mass which makes it increasingly more difficult to achieve pull ups!

Ever wonder what it could feel like to:
✅ Have more energy
✅ Enjoy a good morning routine
✅ Not struggle lifting the groceries
✅ Look in the mirror and not hate what you see
✅ Try on clothes in a shop and feel good
✅ Rock a bikini at any time of year
✅ Lift more weights than your partner 🙊

A. Play sports
B. Lose weight

Let’s show them - being strong is empowering. Exercise is fun and enjoyable and not a method of burning calories 🔥

Here are some common problems I see -

1. When I started spending more time in the gym than on the pitch - I realised - the pitch was not for me anymore 🥲 (this probably won’t apply to an injured athlete)

2. Stop with all the volume - you SHOULDN’T have dead legs going to play your match if you have a sports specific programme. You are either doing too much volume (following a generic programme) or not recovering well enough.

3. Females in particular tend to have a tendency to underestimate when it comes to sports. If you’re not fuelling adequately - you’re putting your performance at major risk!

4. Sleep and hydration are the two most important factors for recovery. Worry about ice baths, massages and sleep when you have these nailed!

She initially wanted to lose 6kg, prioritise herself and feel better in herself - physically and mentally! 

12 months working together and The physical results speak for themselves 🙏💪

If you are choosing a long term sustainable lifestyle over a quick fix - no food is off limits ❌❌❌

So enjoying a little bit of chocolate or cake or jellies is more than ok 🙏

Personally, I opt for wholefood options over lower calorie options - so here's a list of some of my go to's 🙌 

Remember, at the end of the day, the food you consume needs to align with your goals if you want to see results. There is no point choosing 'healthier' options if fat loss is a goal and you're not tracking calories 🙈

9,2022-08-24T19:42:04+0000,"🚨Struggling to see results in the gym🚨

Here’s so of my top tips

1. Find a programme that aligns with your goals. Progressively overload. Amen 🙏 
Random classes = random results.

2. Be consistent. You could have the best programme in the world but unless you’re actually being consistent with it - it’s useless. Don’t be disappointed with the results you didn’t achieve from the work you didn’t put in! 

3. Do the boring exercises. Squat, Hinge, Push, Pull, Lunge and Carry every week - and you’re onto a winner.

4. For consistency, enjoyment and fulfilment to happen - you need to have something you really enjoy in there too - for me that’s a metcon 😍

If you’re struggling to see results in the gym - there’s a number of reasons it may not be working for you. But make sure you’re putting in the work in the gym and in the kitchen before blaming the programme 🙊 I see this one very often. 🙊 And if you’re not happy or satisfied - there are always other options.

If you want help on training and nutrition - Dm me ‘HELP’ 🙏🚨

Strength training is NOT just about here and now - your future self is actually thanking you 🙏 

Why?

Because as we age our muscle mass and bone mass density declines, resistance training helps offset this otherwise dramatic loss of muscle and bone mineral density.

Evidence suggest resistance based training in cancer survivors is not only well-tolerated in cancer patients, but also a tool to counteract adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. 

Resistance training in youths is not only safe but is also a great way to prepare their bodies for the physical demands of sport.

Resistance training in athletes is a pivotal part of every sport.

So if resistance or strength training is so important to everyone - young, old, sick, or sporty - why isn’t everyone doing it? 🤔

1. Amino Acids are proteins building blocks and we NEED these for recovery. Remember recovery is not only essential if you train, our bodies recover every single day.

2. Satiety - every sit down to eat 3 chicken breasts? Doubtful because protein rich foods are so filling. They also help stabilise our blood sugars and reduce cravings. So get your protein in 👊

3. Thermic Effect from Food (TEF) - Did you know that TEF has the same effect on our TDEE as purposeful exercise? 🤔 Did you know protein actually requires more energy to break down than fats or carbohydrates? 🤔 So double whammy here 👊

1. Lack of consistency - this is usually the main problem. Working hard Monday to Friday to blow it all at weekends. Strict rigid dieting for 6 weeks to blow it all for the 6 months afterwards. Consistency is KEY to achieving your results.

2. You are impatient - we want results yesterday 😖 As opposed to playing the long game with our health, we put a time line on it and expect our results to reflect that time line.

3. Your goals are totally unrealistic - Having abs as a female (for majority of females) requires two things.
A. An unhealthy body fat percentage 
B. Sacrifices most people are NOT willing to make to achieve it. 
So lower your expectations 🙏

4. What is your why? 
I want to lose weight is not enough. When the motivation is low - ‘I want to lose weight won’t cut it’. 

‘I want to feel amazing on my wedding day’ 
‘I want enough energy to play with my kids’
‘I want to feel comfortable in a bikini’ 
👆these will 👆

5. No roadmap to your goals - this is a very common one. A lot of people set off on their health and fitness journeys alone with no support or help. A majority fail - why? They have absolutely no guidance, no help and no clear cut roadmap to HOW they achieve their results.

Stop. With. The. Nonsense ✋

Just because a scale weight fluctuates this is not an excuse for you to throw in the towel.

Anyone who has ever played sport - if the other team scores do you just quit? No you continue playing until the end.

Unlike sport, your health and fitness should not have an end date or time. You should always be playing the long game and finding a sustainable approach to the person you want to become.

An area I know a lot of people struggle with is increasing protein in their diet. Based on the poll I put up yesterday - those who wanted more help - I’ve tagged you 🙋‍♀️

Main meals seem to be easier to get protein in but there's definitely a disconnect when it comes to protein snacks. Although keep an eye for protein in main meals too. 

While most people would have protein bars etc. Included in here - a lot of these options are highly processed and the protein quality is poor (I am NOT saying don't eat them. I would just not be relying heavily on them for protein sources).

11,2022-07-22T20:43:39+0000,"Throwback to one of my last trips away. Next on the agenda is Fiji 🇫🇯❤️ 

A parcel arrived yesterday with some holiday and summer pieces and it got me thinking 🤔 

Things have changed so much in the last few years…

A few years ago, 4 weeks out from a holiday I would be cutting carbs and doing crunches for that bikini 👙 

Now, the bikini takes me as I am. ❤️

There is nothing WRONG with wanting to look and feel good in a bikini. Actually the total contrary I think it is VITALLY important for us. 

But contrary to what people think, being smaller DOES NOT equal happier 😱

If you are not happy in a bikini, you need to find out why 🤔 When you get to the root of it, more often than not you’ll realise the bikini was never the problem! 

I strived to be smaller and leaner. And at my smallest and leanest, I was still direly uncomfortable in a bikini 😱🥹

Now, I’m happy, healthy and strong. I’m at least a dress size bigger and sometimes I chaf 🙊 But, now putting on a bikini does not bother me.

I want to help women realise your dress size has nothing to do with your happiness. That scale weight is just one representation of progress. I want women to put on a bikini and stop worrying about how they look and focus more on how they feel ❤️

This is my mission. I’m already on the road to success. Who wants to join me? 🥂",50,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/295184417_567163561800241_7834060944720022640_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=AWMvPSWClMgAX-SYyTk&_nc_oc=AQn4XI8heH--GqugMvWhNkXw9DzKCPzskpO1pFUh9Run08dzMEjNefz3YF3XRo-1vGhB6dIaXONG3l8PD9BhAscW&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfAeVAifDEYjcAi6Lzp5YbtNI1_xoVIxBeQuGdgkaHDAXQ&oe=63D8B5B1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CgVBFpfBzXn/,17847897368803588,,,,

Thanks @niamhmulvey who started the day with a lovely meditation and set us up for the day 🙏 To my incredible colleagues @chris.strengthandmovementlab @d_rigknee who put the women through some movement and educated them on the importance of movement and training 💪 @strengthandmovementlab was the perfect facility for the workshop and I feel very grateful to work in a space that have the same ethos as me 🙏

Thank you to all you beautiful ladies who took part. I can’t describe how happy I am ❤️ But I know this will NOT be the last one 🙏",56,8,VIDEO,REELS,,https://www.instagram.com/reel/CgGr3dYBCcA/,17915281859537243,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/293847138_418883943622177_4035964863652876222_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=Z1x4-Mlfci4AX-T10yy&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfCYcnRDZrCdapKHaa0R8XBe71BrgY5g6a-cxnyqATLsFA&oe=63D7C0CE,"[{'timestamp': '2022-07-17T11:22:51+0000', 'text': '❤️ so sad I missed it.', 'username': 'lyzahmua', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2022-07-17T19:15:01+0000', 'text': '@lyzahmua it won’t be the last 💪', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '17950722257000781'}]}, 'id': '17854598564787248'}, {'timestamp': '2022-07-17T09:59:37+0000', 'text': 'The best day!

Yep I overthink everything. I’ve a situation made up in my head, I have the whole story told to myself and it has about 10 endings - all of them negative 🙊😱 I’m working on this.

Do you overthink?

Do you write your own story. Do you tell yourself 
- I’m not good enough
- I’ll never be able
- I’m too old
- I’m not fit enough
- I could never look like that

If you DIDN’T overthink - what would be the outcome? What could the best possible case scenario be? 

Because let me tell you - YOU AND YOUR MIND are the ONLY things holding you back.

If you don’t try - that is the ONLY time you will fail. 

Quick story - once upon a time I studied to become a fitness instructor. I felt so far out of my depth at the gym with everyone that was there. We had to strength test. One of the tests was chin ups (I was no where NEAR being able to do a chin up) so the alternative was an inverted row. I couldn’t even do 1 inverted row. Last week, I did a workout with 15 Inverted Rows which I did WITH EASE!!!! 8 years later, the effort I have been putting in is coming to fruition.

1. Most important is frequency and volume 
✅ Pull Ups - Slow eccentrics, change grip, use Rings/Trx 
✅ Bench Press - Dumbbell Press, Floor Press, Push Ups, Inclince Press

You need to be hitting some form of these movements AT LEAST twice a week to progress.

2. Assistance Exercises 
It’s not all about doing more and more volume. Are you doing other back exercises to build a strong back? Do you neglect isolation exercises? 
A good programme will incorporate all of the above.

3. Nutrition for performance
If you are not eating enough, of course performance will suffer. Eat to fuel your body 🥦🍏🍉🥑🍚

Fat gets a bad rep. 
Sure it is 9Kcal per gram but it is an essential part of a balanced fat. 
.
.
Fats provide us with energy, makes up our cell membranes of our brain and nervous system. Fats are necessary to transport vitamins A,D,E and K and make and balance certain hormones.
.
.
Dietary Fat can be found in 2 forms:
Saturated – mainly found in animal products like meat, dairy, eggs, coconut
Unsaturated – found in marine sources like fish oils, as well as nuts, seeds and vegetable oils
.
. 
For years saturated fat was thought to be associated with higher risk of Cardiovascular Disease and so it was deemed as ‘unhealthy’ or ‘bad for you’. The problem with saturated fat was not the actual fat itself but rather the increased consumption of processed food or the large quantities of saturated fat products. Saturated fat helps increase the cholesterol production in the body which is an essential part of metabolism and in the production of steroid hormones. So saturated fat should feature in our diet, just maybe don’t latter every meal in butter.
.
. 
Unsaturated fats are made up of mono and polyunsaturated fats.  These contain our omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids. Omega 3 fatty acids open our airways and blood vessels. They reduce our blood lipids and cholesterol and lower inflammation and pain. Omega 6 fatty acids do the opposite. Both are needed in the body, without both we wouldn’t heal or recover from exercise. The problem with Western diets is that we don’t have the proper ratios. We are at about 10:1 where we should be at 2:1 (omega 6/omega 3).
.
. 
Low fat diets were a fad a few years ago. While people reduced calories, they increased their intake of processed foods. Diets lacked fats and fat soluble vitamins so instead of being healthier people were losing weight but were not healthier.
.
. 
Fats are an essential part of any healthy diet. Be aware that they are very calorie dense so portion control may be important and don’t opt for processed versions. Enjoy them as part of a balanced lifestyle.

17,2022-06-20T19:44:07+0000,"By saying yes to something - you are ultimately saying no to something else.

I’ll give you a little example - at the weekend I had a CrossFit competition - it meant I had to say no to a friends birthday on Saturday.

For years and years, I gave up all my social Occassions to say yes to playing football.

I used to be a yes person. I would say yes to everything - I’d help everyone.
At one stage when I lived at home I was:
Managing a gym, looking after my mother who was in hospital, playing football with Roscommon and Garrycastle, helping train Roscommon u14 girls AND Garrycastle Minor girls 😵‍💫🥴 That’s not to mention trying to spend time with my partner and friends.

I learned how to say no from working with a life coach and it was one of the best things I’ve ever learned to do. I encourage and promote saying no to things with my clients too.

Saying no has added benefits - not only are you NOT doing what you don’t WANT to do but you end up saying yes to what you do want.

An example of saying no. Last bank holiday weekend I refused to make plans - I wanted to just go with the flow - see what happened, I ultimately wanted to chill. I said no to making plans and in turn I had a lovely chilled, relaxed weekend 🫶

Here are some of my top tips:
❌ Stop using coffee as an appetite suppressant 
🚫 Does having a little milk in your coffee break your fast? Who cares 🙊
❌ Stop abusing it - do you need 17 cups a day - highly unlikely
🚫 More coffee ≠ more energy (quite often over consumption of coffee will lead to you feeling burnt out and tired)
❌ Stop drinking it in the afternoon - I don’t care if you say ‘it doesn’t affect me’ - it most likely DOES affect your sleep quality

✅ Enjoy in moderation 
✅ If you have a sensitive stomach - perhaps eat before your morning coffee

I have Sundays free…
I don’t feel like I have 2 jobs…
I actually get to see my boyfriend…

So honestly, no I don’t miss the sport.

That’s not to say I don’t miss the people ❤️

But I still get the team training environment. I still eat, sleep and train like an athlete.
And I have so much more free time and control of what I do.

I don’t regret playing football. It was some of the best years of my life. And some of the life skills I’ve learned - I owe to football. But for me, the fire quenched a long time before quitting. 

If there is a part of your life, you’re not happy with. You have full control of changing it.

I didn’t quit football out of fear of not being ‘Amanda the footballer’ anymore. It was actually such an engrained part of my character. And now, the people I’ve met in Australia have never even met that person 😅

❌ You wouldn’t put the wrong fuel into your car? Why? It’d damage the engine? 

❌ You wouldn’t let your battery go dead on your phone? Why? Because you need your phone!

By choosing to make poor food choices, drink too much alcohol and not drink enough water - we are choosing to fill our bodies with the ‘wrong fuel’. By choosing to not prioritise sleep and be sedentary, we have no energy. 

The choices you make daily shape and align the person you become.

❌No goals are achieved overnight

It doesn’t matter how slow you are going - forward is forward - 10km/h or 100 km/h you will still get to your destination 🫶

Quitting or stopping is the only way we don’t get there 🫣

I had the CrossFit Open, Quarter Finals, I did the Age Group QF, an in house comp, a Spartan race and an in person comp. On top of that I had a crazy social life along with a trip to Melbourne and Brisbane.

.
.
I pride myself on it actually. I've alway been a pro choice kinda girl in all aspects of life (not just health and fitness related). You'll never hear me boast about one type of diet or slate any either. You won't hear me downgrade any form of exercise, although I do openly talk about the huge benefits of resistance training 💪 I'll never tell any of my client's 'you cannot eat this for weight loss'. If someone who loves yoga comes to me, I'm not going to force them to lift weights. And if someone who is vegan comes to me, I would not force them to eat animal products. My problem with any of these things lies in the misinformation. 
.
.
Did you know that vegan fast food production has sky rocketed in recent years? 🤔 Similarly, a few years ago, gluten free products were a huge trend? And before that, sugar free was the hype? This I have a problem with.
.
.
Veganism is a lifestyle choice. I have huge respect for anyone's lifestyle choices, whether they conform to my own is irrelevant. What actually annoys me is actual vegans are getting a terrible name due to all these people jumping on the bandwagon, thinking veganism is the healthiest lifestyle going. People are going into this lifestyle, uneducated and naive. 😒 It was the same a few years ago when gluten free was the buzzword. Did you know you can have a totally adequate, balanced, healthy diet without adding one gluten free product? And thats for ACTUAL coeliacs out there, because they are the ONLY people that need to be eating gluten free toast 😂
.
.
What my very long winded post is trying to say is stop jumping on bandwagons. If you are and always have been vegan, that's fine. Continue with your choices. If you are coeliac, continue with your gluten free bread 🙈 
.
For the rest of you, stop following trends by the latest celebrity diet.
❎ Stop conforming to social norms ✊ 
❎Stop basing your beliefs on a bloody stupid documentary 😒 
✅Get some advice from a professional. 🙏
✅ Follow said advice 🌈 
✅ And unfollow anyone giving terrible, uneducated advice

Take a look at how some of my Strong and Sassy females did: 

- What Laura has lost on the scales, she has gained in self confidence 

- Eibhlin (busy mum) changed the shape of her body and she has never been stronger 

- Aine lost kilos on the scales and added kilos on the barbell

- Are committed to finally changing your habits.
- Are able to train 3 times a week
- Consider yourself to be coachable
- And are ready to get pushed out of your comfort zone.

1. Being consistently good is better than being occasionally perfect.

2. The weekend makes up a large part of the week. If you think you’re being good during the week and not making progress - take a look at your weekends.

3. Sleep is one of the most underestimated tools to help you achieve ANY goal. If you’re sleep is shit and you’re sacrificing it ‘to seize the morning’ and train at 6am - you may be doing more harm than good.

4. Water consumption is the simplest way to becoming a healthier version of yourself. Stop looking at fad diets, detox teas, apple cider vinegar and look at your hydration status. Dehydration affects every system in our body and can lead to lack of energy, low mood, injury and brain fog (to mention afew).

5. Human connection, vitamin D and exercise are some of the most under utilised mental health prescriptions. Try increase all of these on the daily to see an instant mood shift 🙏

6. Stop trying to be a people pleaser and learn to say no - you are your own most important asset. 

7. Live every day like it’s your last ❤️ Do what makes you happy!

👉 Instead of spending hours watching the ‘calories you’re burning’ why not swap for getting stronger instead 💪

👉 Instead of a meal plan why not become totally equipped to make better food choices for yourself

👉 Instead of trying to ‘eat clean’ why not find an 80/20 balance and count calories 

👉 Instead of trying to exercise more - sleep more

👉Instead of trying to use detox teas, shakes and ACV - drink more water

Obviously, I am not promoting drinking alcohol but for quite a few people I know - would like to incorporate the things they enjoy into their calories - and here is a prime example.

Unfortunately, to gain alcohol - calories had to be taken away somewhere and protein has taken a little hit in this day.

But the idea of this post is to show you - you can incorporate the foods you enjoy and STILL achieve results 🙌 (P.S I personally prefer eating my calories 🤤)

3,2022-05-07T06:06:56+0000,"Yesterday, I mentioned a common problem i see in women trying to become bikini confident. 

Women lack education and understanding around nutrition which causes serial yo yo dieting. 

To fix this problem, you need more nutrition education on how you can eat the foods you love and still get the results you deserve. 

Here's how it works: 

As a qualified nutritionist, I educate females on how to make good food choices to achieve their goals. I don't focus on short term quick fixes but long term sustainable results. I genuinely believe if you hand someone a diet plan you will only help them so far,  but if you educate them on a balanced lifestyle - this is invaluable.

💥 If you are a student, unsure of your path. Please talk to a career guidance teacher.

💥 If you are sick. See a doctor.
💥 If you are having mental health issues, a counsellor may be an option
💥 If you're having car troubles, go to a mechanic.
💥 If your phone isn't working, bring it to a phone shop.

Eibhlin is a 42 year old busy mum of 3. She wanted to do my Strong and Sassy programme as has a big holiday coming up in June and ‘wanted to feel stronger and more confident’.

Before we started working together, Eibhlin had been through a few lockdowns, had developed some bad nutrition habits and had lost a lot of fitness. With her holiday looming, she wanted to gain structure as well as get fitter and stronger. 

She delayed a little in reaching out to me as she wasn’t 100% ready but as soon as she did - she signed up straight away - knowing this was the right programmme for her. 

‘The app is great and I realise I actually love working out on my own! I can do it in my time and the programme is tailored to me’

Fast forward 2 months and Eibhlin cannot believe the change in her progress photos. She had no originally joined for weight loss but is pleasantly surprised by the secondary effects of an overall healthy lifestyle.

They feel they have no time to go to the gym because they are too busy. 

Thankfully a lot of my clients train from home 3 times a week with minimal equipment. 

You see the thing is - you don't actually need hours in the gym to achieve your goals - especially if you're crazy busy. I also encourage women to make better choices if they are too busy to cook. And instead of scrolling on Social media - I set step targets for them (even if they scroll while they walk). 

You see - it's pretty simple. Try this out and let me know how it goes.

9,2022-05-04T08:40:23+0000,"Another common problem I see most women have when they are trying to change their body shape is time to commit to a programme. 

We all lead such busy lifestyles these days. We give time to our families, our friends, and work and we are left with little to no time. 

It's so frustrating because you're trying to be a good friend, mother, daughter, sister, colleague, or employee. But what's left for you? Or maybe there is time? 

I've found that most people usually can find time. Maybe instead of an hour of Netflix we could swap it for a workout? Maybe instead of scrolling we could be walking? Or instead of picking up a takeaway on the way home from work, we could pick up a ready meal in a supermarket? The problem lies in trying to do too much.

Are you interested in learning about how you could commit to a programme even WITH limited time?

10,2022-05-03T19:46:31+0000,"How Helen changed her habits and became more confident over 12 weeks. 

Helen has been training on and off for years. Her main goal was to get into a good routine and be accountable. She was looking for a long term sustainable change - without restriction. 

Before we started working together Helen did programmes and trained - but as soon as she had a bad week or didn’t see the scales moving - she gave up. She found herself unhappy in her clothes and she was sick of stopping and starting. 

She hesitated in starting because of pride ‘She thought she could and should do it alone’. And if she's honest, she thought ‘I know what to do’. But she realised she needed direction, accountability and a community - which drove her to take action.

'I knew others who did Amanda’s programme and I knew it had a personal approach' ‘I knew there was a community environment to it and I liked that’

Fast forward 12 weeks and she feels so much happier and more confident.

'This programme is for anyone who is lacking direction’

11,2022-05-03T06:20:39+0000,"How I became stronger, happier and more confident and how you can too. 

When I started in the fitness industry I was a little lost. I was focused on how I looked. I was obsessed with having abs. I only ate 'clean' food mid week which led to weekend binges. My relationship with nutrition and fitness definitely was not a healthy one. 

I wasn't happy. Not in my body. Not in my mind. I genuinely couldn't imagine continuing my life with this level of restriction and I began to resent the gym 😢 

Then I stopped focusing so much on HOW I looked. I stopped looking for abs every time I walked by the mirror. I started to appreciate resistance training and I began focusing on how much stronger I was becoming. My goals changed. Performance based goals replaced the quest for abs and I found my love for exercise again. I found a balanced approach to nutrition. I still eat very healthy and nutritious but I no longer restrict myself. 

I no longer focus on HOW I look but WHAT my body can do. I wear bikinis now without dieting to get in them. I'm stronger and fitter than I've ever been and clothes sizes no longer dictate my life. I'm happier and healthier. I love the skin I'm in ❤ 

And that's why I created my Strong and Sassy Programme to help women become bikini confident year round without restrictions.

No matter what diet they do, they can't stick to it at weekends.... 

To fix this problem I get my clients to find their non negotiables. 

What are non negotiables?
They are habits you can stick to NO MATTER WHAT the circumstances are. 

I usually recommend 3 of them.. 

3 things you can stick to every weekend.
For example - Drink 2 litres of water, walk 10,000 steps daily and 1 piece of fruit.

You may notice yourself cutting calories during the week and then all hell breaks lose at weekends and you're afraid that if you continue this way you'll never achieve that bikini body 😢 

It's so frustrating because you're really trying to make a change. What's actually causing this is a binge restrict cycle that you've developed over the years. We only know and understand nutrition at 2 levels - 'really good' or 'really bad' 

I've found the best solution to fix this is to SAY NO to the all or nothing approach - but this will require help. Accountability to someone who knows what they're talking about can definitely help with this. I've also found having non negotiables proves very helpful.

I’ve had a busy April 🫠 Between the F1, Easter and Owen’s birthday my body has been through the ringer 😵🙊

The first 3 months of the year were very much training and competition focused so it’s very important to me I get a good balance between training and socialising (at the end of the day - I’m not a full time athlete 😅) 

April has been my busiest month since January and I’m so excited to be helping clients get bikini confident for Summer 🙏(life is finally getting back to normality and holidays are back on the cards 🥳) Some of my clients will be wearing a bikini with confidence this year for 'THE FIRST TIME EVER'!!!!!! Mind blowing 🥳🤯

.

When people said to Arnold Schwarzenegger 
'Oh but I don't want to look like you.'

He replied:
'Don't worry. You never will.'
.
.
Let me tell you. Building muscle is BLOODY HARD. You don't just wake up one day and 'are bulky' 😅😅😅
.
.
I've spent YEARS improving myself and getting stronger, fitter and healthier. That is my goal. So don't think after lifting afew weights you're going to gain 10kg of muscle and look 'bulky'. And honestly, most people will NEVER EVER train as hard as I train 😅 
.
.
But let me also tell you. Majority of the photos I take are mid or post training when I have a serious pump. In normal clothes, I'm a normal size 8-10 female. I don't have jacked quads or a shoulder vein 😅 (Even though I'd be happy to walk around like that)
.
.
Moral of the story: most people will never train hard enough to get bulky. Most people don't walk round jacked 😅 The 'toned' look you want is actually muscle - so if you say you want to be 'toned' and don't want muscle you're actually contradicting yourself 😅

Oh and if it wasn't already obvious - lift weights 🏋‍♀️

Not only is resistance based training optimal for a fat loss goal but it also increases lean muscle mass and bone mineral density - I call that BANG for your buck 💸

- Are committed to finally changing your habits.
- Are able to train 3 times a week
- Consider yourself to be coachable
- And are ready to get pushed out of your comfort zone.

15,2022-03-30T05:42:45+0000,"Why are you so anti weight loss? 🤔

LET’S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT. I am NOT anti weight loss. I am pro health. If weight loss is going to make you healthier - I am ALL for it 🙋‍♀️

But let’s get one thing straight. Weight loss ≠ happiness. 

Let me tell you something personal - that not many people know/realise.

When I was younger, I dressed to impress. Not myself but others. I craved attention so much, I wore clothes to reflect the amount of attention I knew I’d receive. I made out that I was this confident queen when inside I was falling apart 😢

Fast forward to now - I dress for me 💃 I feel like the belle of the ball when I wear something that shows off my strong, healthy body ❤️ 

My point - I don’t look much different from then until now. But my mindset - poles apart. 🙏

So I will reiterate - Health is and always will be my number 1 priority - physical and mental. Being happy, comfortable and confident is a really difficult place to get to and no scale weight or clothes size will measure that. 

Everyday I am changing people’s lives - scales drop as a bi product of a healthier lifestyle. But their happiness, confidence and self worth is the goal 🦋🙌

If you’re interested in becoming the healthiest, happiest, most confident version of yourself.

✅Workout 4 - 10kg PB on Overhead Squat (with more in the tank)

✅Workout 5 - Those snatches 🏋️‍♀️

NO lowlights - but always things to learn.

👉 SHSPUS are still a gaping hole in my armour. I had almost 3 mins to get 10 of them and could only manage 1(I know shoulders were toast but I still need to improve)
👉 Gymnastics is my big focus for the next few months

1. Amino Acids are proteins building blocks and we NEED these for recovery. Remember recovery is not only essential if you train, our bodies recover every single day.

2. Satiety - every sit down to eat 3 chicken breasts? Doubtful because protein rich foods are so filling. They also help stabilise our blood sugars and reduce cravings. So get your protein in 👊

3. Thermic Effect from Food (TEF) - Did you know that TEF has the same effect on our TDEE as purposeful exercise? 🤔 Did you know protein actually requires more energy to break down than fats or carbohydrates? 🤔 So double whammy here 👊

This one is important.

For those of you who don’t know - my Dad died of pancreatic cancer aged 50 (5 days before his 51st birthday).

Since his death, two things have been hugely prominent in my life - 
1. Your health is your wealth 
2. I was put on this Earth to help people 

Yesterday I paid almost $600 on blood tests. The receptionist asked me ‘Are you sure you want this one? It’s the most expensive’ (the blood test in Question was related to my Dads condition which I want to do any test for that I can). 
I actually couldn’t believe she asked me that 🤔 But I realised people have probably declined to pay that price. I’m not gonna lie the price came as a shock to me, and I had to fiddle between bank accounts to hand it over. But never ONCE did it cross my mind to not pay. You see to me, my health is priceless. I am willing to invest or hand over WHATEVER I need to, to ensure I am as healthy as I possibly can be. And to me, that money was a NECESSITY! 

I cannot believe people put a price on their health 😱 Your health literally is your wealth! 

That brings me to my second realisation. I need to help as many women as possible in this world to realise your health is your wealth. Not just physical, but mental too. 
⛔️Hating your body is not healthy
⛔️ Constant dieting is not healthy
⛔️ Exercising to burn calories is not healthy
⛔️ Trying to look like someone else is not healthy

I want to educate women about nutrition without restriction. I want to help women become the healthiest, happiest, most confident versions of themselves ❤️🙏

Here are some examples of meals I used to eat on the go. (P.S I still eat a lot of these types of meals because convenience is key for me 😜) but luckily now I get @hunger_gains_ - convenience and amazing tasting healthy food. Win win 🥳🙋‍♀️

All of these require minimal time and effort. And you knit pick and say 'Packet bought chicken isn't the healthiest?' Well Susan... it's better than that sausage roll you reached for last week 🙈😅

Oh if only I had her legs 🤔

Why does she have a washboard stomach and I don't 😭

Omg would she ever cover up. Who does she think she is 🙀

I was so obsessed with comparing myself to other women. I was so certain if I looked like other people I would be happier in my own body. I was indoctrinated. I used to look up Owen's exes for Christ sake and compare myself 😅 (Just so you know if any of you follow me 😅). 
.
.
So how did I get to present day Amanda? My God it took time and a lot of effort. Took some counselling too 🤟 Becoming happy comfortable and confident in my body took gratitude, talking to myself and listening to a lot of positive self help books. 
.
.
I started to appreciate how incredible my body is. Not for what it looks like but what it can do. And after that changed, so did my whole outlook.
.
.
I still get a little envious (of a good tan 😍😍😍) but I'm pretty darn happy with my body. I no longer compare it to smaller waist sizes. I'm not upset any more that I have a little pouch (that's my happiness pouch). 
.
.
I'm proud of my body. And you should be too ❤

P.s Appreciating a rocking body is different 😍 I'm allllllll about that
👊 But I'm happy in my own 👊

Elaine came to me as a footballer with goals to prevent injury and get stronger.

One of my fondest memories of Elaine during my programme was her epiphany of taking progress photos.
‘I don’t want to take them every 2 weeks because I know if I don’t see results I’ll get disheartened. I’m happy with how I’m doing and I don’t need justification through photos’.

Here are some of the implications that have happened because of my coaching:

‘Nicole felt great in a dress she wore at the weekend. Her boyfriend thought it was lovely to not hear her give out about herself for once’. 

‘Colleen’s husband was so proud of her for throwing out her weighing scales’

‘Karen’s daughter does her stretching and burpees with her’

Find yourself a new coach 👊

One of the saddest things I hear from females is past experiences with old coaches 😢 I’ve had numerous women who had been made feel like a failure because ‘They weren’t losing enough/expected amount of weight on scale each week’. ‘They were made to feel like they failed’

Ok coaches look I get it - a woman comes to you with one goal you want to help her achieve said goal. 

My approach with women is a little less hardcore. I’ve developed a soft spot. I think it’s important that if a female has not achieved her desired result you educate her on why this possibly occurred. Then, focus on what did happen over that time period - all the positives they achieved 🙏

My approach is ‘yes weight loss can and will occur but let’s focus on enjoying exercise, educating ourselves on nutrition and finding a lifestyle we can sustain forever.

Firstly, do you track your period? Do you even know when your period is due? If not, why not?
Cycles are a very important part of a woman's life and a lot of elements can be affected at different phases of our cycle and not just our hormones 🙀 💥Have you ever noticed you're more productive at certain times? 
💥 Noticed you're stronger at certain times?
💥 Is your sleep affected at certain times? 
What gets measured gets managed 👊👊👊
.
.
OK, so you've started tracking...
And you notice, ok my cycle length is a lot longer than normal (21-35 days). You know you're not pregnant (immaculate conception 😇). So what could it be?
.
.
There are many factors that may contribute to your irregular cycle.

Comfort zones are great. Spending ‘most’ of your time there is fine - normal if you will. But if you want to grow you need to get out of that comfort zone.

Today I did just that. For a girl that is afraid to rock climb with a harness on, I was on clawing my way up a mountain today 😱

Ever heard the sayings -
 ‘Nothing changes if nothing changes 🤷‍♀️’

Or

‘If you want a different result - make a different choice’

When was the last time you ventured outside that comfort zone!?

❇️Maybe it was quitting a job you hate without having another opportunity lined up?
❇️Maybe it starting a new sport
❇️Maybe it was having a cold shower
❇️Maybe it was trying a new food
❇️Maybe it was speaking on instagram stories
❇️Maybe it was travelling

The list goes on…

I encourage you all to do it. It’s something I try to do multiple times a week (I’d like to say daily but I don’t think I do it that often). 
Adrenaline is an important hormone in our body and it is encouraged to release it (nobody is saying you have to sign up for an ultra marathon or live in the Antarctic).

Original Goal when you started with me?

- Improve relationship with food, feel better in myself, lose weight

Largest Obstacle/ Problem separating you from achieving that goal?

-Lack of understanding with nutrition, exercise

How do you feel I helped you overcome the problem?

-Education with nutrition, even though I struggled with exercise due to factors out of my control, my relationship with food and the improvements I made still resulted in a weight loss but more importantly improved mood, improved skin, more energy and overall mental health is much better.",11,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/273977141_294096162711948_7557838876069324297_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=wp46_bDRJQYAX9Qx2GJ&_nc_oc=AQkko6-Q9AdCM1zI2tgISeWjDIHqgxWvPxD924o6S1HpjxM7ZHFgzCzm_Pq1lsqZysgB-2zhUzwJTbPvNSbnbq5F&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfAdpKaSDKP50Gf3UUdPehvLjq1p6E1hGF9nWOhblJm5cw&oe=63D7BE00,https://www.instagram.com/p/CaApbbWhCkF/,18048702646310213,,,,

Here's a reminder that the number 1 love in your life should be yourself 💕

Let's take this opportunity to appreciate, be happy and confident in our own bodies- no matter their shape or size 🙏 

Let's start normalising positive self image instead of tearing ourselves down all the time. Note: you'd never say to friends the things you'd say to yourself😑

Let's stop worrying about a 'bad weekend' and understand living is part of your life 🤦‍♀️

I celebrate client wins every single week. I now even do a coaching call every month dedicated to client wins 🥳 Why? Because I need to celebrate how God damn incredible my clients are AND they need to realise how amazing they are too 🥰💃

Unfortunately, especially as females we tend to focus heavily on what we CAN'T do or all the WRONG we do. We never give ourselves a pat on the back or celebrate all we CAN do 🥳💪 So I want to change that ✅

Wins are not always MASSIVE. Although shout out to Aine who will be completing a half marathon at the weekend 🏃‍♀️

Take a look through some of my clients wins this week.

- Picture 1 - Hitting calories and Protein through a Vegan diet ✅

- Picture 2 - I don't TELL my clients what to do when it comes to nutrition. I educate them and let them make their own decisions. Helen decided to be disciplined and chose just to have water at the cinema. Juliet opted for salads to chips. These are all DECISIONS made by clients. 

- Picture 3 - My coaching is MORE than just nutrition and training. Being organised has a knock on effect on your mental health. I try to encompass and encourage a Hollistic approach to health 🙏 Rest and Recovery are absolutely vital for our body. As I have a lot of athletes, it is so important not only their nutrition and training is on point but that they know how to recovery properly ✅

In Fact if anything I think you're a little more courageous 
🤩🤩🤩
.
.
You are not expected to know everything. That's why people have occupations with the relevant knowledge and skills to help 👌
.
.
💥 If you are a student, unsure of your path. Please talk to a career guidance teacher.
💥 If you are unsure of your career and thinking about changing everything for a different route. Maybe you could see a life coach.
💥 If you are sick. See a doctor.
💥 If you are having mental health issues, a counsellor may be an option
💥 If you're having car troubles, go to a mechanic.
💥 If your phone isn't working, bring it to a phone shop.
.
.
See the trend???
.
.
Once upon a time I thought I was totally independent. I didn't want to ask for help from anyone!!! But then I realised, I can't do it all alone and actually support and guidance is the best thing I could get. NOW, I ask for help all the time. From family, friends, and colleagues. I have a coach. If my mental health is affecting me I call someone for help. One of the best things I ever did was see a life coach ❤
.
.
Why is it so hard for people to see the same applies to training and nutrition? 🥴🥴🥴 You could be spending weeks, months or even years trying to do it alone? 🙈 Wasting your time and money in the process. If you aren't qualified in the area. YOU CAN ALWAYS ASK FOR HELP 🙏 Please please stop making poor nutrition choices based on what Google told you. Stop wasting time trying to 'shred belly fat' based on a free workout Susan gave you.

Ask for help. Stop wasting your time. I'm literally just a phone call away.

If you are choosing a long term sustainable lifestyle over a quick fix - no food is off limits ❌❌❌

So enjoying a little bit of chocolate or cake or jellies is more than ok 🙏

Personally, I opt for wholefood options over lower calorie options - so here's a list of some of my go to's 🙌 

Remember, at the end of the day, the food you consume needs to align with your goals if you want to see results. There is no point choosing 'healthier' options if fat loss is a goal and you're not tracking calories 🙈

Original Goal
Lose fat and build a better relationship with food and exercise 

How do you think I've helped you
With the knowledge and understanding I’ve learned from Amanda I can make the same (yummy and exciting) meals as pre-coaching but within my daily macros. My habits or non negotiables are drilled into me (and those close to me) 🤣 ie STEPS!! water, fruit and veg etc… basics but make such a difference once they are a must EVERYDAY and not just when you feel like it. I’m also subconsciously so much more aware of the different weekly habits I learned like getting enough protein, varied protein sources, eating colour, reading food labels if they have 10’s of ingredients etc etc 

Why you chose to work with me over someone else?
Your Passion and enthusiasm! Also so helpful if having a bad week: never judgey, always give relatable advice and very kind. So good at giving us perspective when being hard on ourselves.

People tend to do exactly the OPPOSITE of what I preach 🤣 I don't believe in the ALL OR NOTHING approach and that's exactly what people tend to do 🙈

✅ Feel like they've failed because they can't sustain 6 days of exercise a week and 1200 cals daily 🤦‍♀️
✅ Back drinking every 2nd night.

- Aine O had a big trip away and 'felt great in her clothes'
- Aine L has dropped 4kg and is back running again
- Anna has got her first EVER push ups
- Post partum Colleen is back bossing her training 
- Helen is feeling the 'happiest she has been in a long time'
- Maeve's work uniform is feeling looser
- Raychel's nutrition is improving daily
- Susan is already feeling stronger physically and mentally.
- Zac weighed in at an all time low 

NO CRAZY RESTRICITIONS 

NO ALCOHOL BANS
NO FOOD IS OFF LIMITS
NO TRAINING 6 DAYS A WEEK

What I've learned over the last 8 years in the fitness industry:
.
.
People THINK eating better, exercising  more and losing weight will make them feel better. 
.
.
What ACTUALLY makes people feel better is healing their relationships with food and exercise. And absolutely no shape, size or weight will make you feel better unless you're happy and content within yourself 🙏

When people said to Arnold Schwarzenegger 
'Oh but I don't want to look like you.'

He replied:
'Don't worry. You never will.'
.
.
Let me tell you. Building muscle is BLOODY HARD. You don't just wake up one day and 'are bulky' 😅😅😅
.
.
I've spent YEARS improving myself and getting stronger, fitter and healthier. That is my goal. So don't think after lifting afew weights you're going to gain 10kg of muscle and look 'bulky'. And honestly, most people will NEVER EVER train as hard as I train 😅 
.
.
But let me also tell you. Majority of the photos I take are mid or post training when I have a serious pump. In normal clothes, I'm a normal size 8-10 female. I don't have jacked quads or a shoulder vein 😅 (Even though I'd be happy to walk around like that)
.
.
Moral of the story: most people will never train hard enough to get bulky. Most people don't walk round jacked 😅 The 'toned' look you want is actually muscle - so if you say you want to be 'toned' and don't want muscle you're actually contradicting yourself 😅

Oh and if it wasn't already obvious - lift weights 🏋‍♀️

P.s Those tan lines though 😅

An area I know a lot of people struggle with is increasing protein in their diet. Main meals seem to be easier to get protein in but there's definitely a disconnect when it comes to protein snacks.

While most people would have protein bars etc. Included in here - a lot of these options are highly processed and the protein quality is poor (I am NOT saying don't eat them. I would just not be relying heavily on them for protein sources).

I know you THINK the latest trend or fancy exercises is what will get you the physique you want - truth is most people don't spend long enough at one thing to get their desired results 🤷‍♀️
.
.
I tend to write about the 'fun' metcons I do. But they accompany and are ADDITIONAL to the strength work I do 🙏
.
.
So stop looking for the next best thing. The best thing is right in front of you - it's the basics. Oh and this time stick at it for life 💪

Sick of chicken and broccoli? 🤔
.
.
You will quickly run out of ideas if you try to change whole meals so why not change up the sides 💁‍♀️
.
.
From my experience, people tend to like certain foods. If you stick with the foods you like, you're more likely to stick with it 🙏 
.
.
So my advice:
- Change the vegetables - not just the type but how you cook them - stir fry, boil, steam, roast. 

- Change the carb source - sick of brown rice? Add quinoa or cous cous! Sick of potato, try sweet potato.

- Rotate Week 1 - Chicken and pork based meals. Week 2 - Tofu and tuna based meals. Week 3 - Turkey & Salmon based meals. Week 4 - Prawn & Beef based meals. And start the cycle again 🙌

.
.
If you haven't already noticed I feel very passionate about helping people. 
.
.
I too, disliked my body image, under fuelled and exercised to burn calories. I too did endless amounts of cardio and crunches in a bid to find abs. And guess what, nothing changed. How I felt about myself didn't change one single bit. Even when I was a size 6 and probably <18% BF with visible abs, I still wasn't happy. 
.
.
And you won't be either, unless you deal with what's going on in your head and understand the 
Importance of your why. 
.
.
My 𝙬𝙝𝙮 is to be a role model 🙋‍♀️ I want younger girls to look up to me. I want peers to understand the message I am preaching. I want older women to see that fad diets and restriction is NOT the answer. I want Dad's to say 'You should listen to that Mc Loone one' (if you know you know 😅).
.
.
My 𝙬𝙝𝙮 is to help as many women as I can become the best versions of themselves. 
💥I want to educate women that you can still enjoy the food you like and be happy. 
💥I want women to see how empowering it is to become physically stronger. 
💥I want to help women see how incredible they are and stop focusing so much on how they look on the outside and see what they have to offer from the inside. 
💥I want to see confidence radiating from the women I work with. 
.
.
I truely believe I was put on this planet for 3 reasons:
1. To help as many people as physically possible.
2. To become the fittest and healthiest version of myself
3. To have loads of animals

Instead of breaking it down to basics and nailing the basics - every year people start off all guns blazing on January 1st with a list of 7 million things to do:
- Drink Detox juices
- Hiit training daily 
- 10,000 Steps
- 1200 Calories
- High Protein foods
- No Carbs
-No sugar
- No alcohol

Would you believe it if I said from that list I only encourage 2 of those with clients?

Would you believe if you don't want to - you never have to do a burpee for the rest of your life?

What if I told you I had a client who lost 30.7kg (yes you heard me right) in 1 year from nailing the basics:
✔ 3 resistance sessions a week
✔ Drink 2L water 
✔ Sleep adequately (this is still her Achilles heel but it's a heck of a lot better)
✔ 10,000 Steps
✔ Focus on food quality 
While still:
✅ Eating the foods she enjoys
✅ Drinking Alcohol
✅ Enjoying the exercise she does

.
.
When people say to me they 'want to lose weight', more often than not - it's fat loss they are actually seeking. And there is a difference 👆
.
.
Weight loss is a combination of fat, muscle and water. When people go on very restrictive diets they often see a huge scale shift on week 1 due to a reduction in total body water - as opposed to fat loss. 
.
.
If people focus solely on scale loss unfortunately there is likely to be muscle mass loss - which is what we don't want. As far as I'm aware some diet clubs actually discourage resistance training as it will lead to muscle gain (and essentially an increase on the scales) 🙈
.
.
Ladies, please please understand smaller ≠ happier 🚫
.
.
If someone is overweight/obese, weight loss should be the goal to a healthier overall body composition 🙏
.
.
Anyone else - Fat Loss is what you should be seeking 👆

I'd hate for you to miss out on results like these:

- Aoibheann lost 5kg in 12 weeks
- Sarah is now benching her old 1RM for 10 reps
- Trish lost inches and kilos while looking after her 2 kids

So - the decision is up to you, and it's super easy to apply.

.
.
I went through a really hard period of my life after my Dad died. As the oldest of his daughters I felt a responsibility to keep my shit together, look after my mother and sister and keep up appearances. It was a struggle. I tried to do this while managing a gym, commuting, playing with 2 football teams, studying, trying to maintain friendships and a relationship. I felt like I was just surviving as opposed to living 😢
.
.
And then I took control of my life. I started to look after myself first and everybody else's needs and wants came second.

The meaning of the tattoo is that even the most beautiful things can come from the ugliest of places. 🙏

I'm not alone. I know we've all had struggles and strifes in our lives. I'm not saying mine has been harder than anyone else's. But I decided to take control of mine. I asked for help. I seeked the help I needed. And I made life changing decisions 💔❤

Women lack education and understanding around nutrition which causes serial yo yo dieting. 

To fix this problem, you need more nutrition education on how you can eat the foods you love and still get the results you deserve. 

Here's how it works: 

As a qualified nutritionist, I educate females on how to make good food choices to achieve their goals. I don't focus on short term quick fixes but long term sustainable results. I genuinely believe if you hand someone a diet plan you will only help them so far,  but if you educate them on a balanced lifestyle - this is invaluable.

Eimear is a GAA footballer in Sydney who was looking to get fitter, stronger and more confident on the pitch. She wanted to do my Strong and Sassy programme as she felt 'she never reached her full potential'. 

Before we started working together, Eimear had been doing her farm work in Austrailia and had developed some bad nutrition habits and had lost a lot of fitness. With her football season looming, she wanted to gain structure as well as get fitter and stronger. 

She has always worked in a face to face setting so she almost didn't reach out to me because she thought the online method 'wouldn't work for her'. She decided to give it a go as she really wanted to make a change. 

'The app was great because it logged all the stats and I wanted to see improvements and log into that'. The programme worked around me, football and my injuries. 

Fast forward 12 weeks and Eimear cannot believe the change it has made not only to her physically but mentally too. Her confidence is through the roof on and off the pitch. 

'If you want a coach who trains you for life. If you want someone who will let you off in to the world to be the best version of yourself' then choose Amanda.' 

If you're like Eimear and want to get fitter, stronger and more confident, I'd love to help you get there.

They feel they have no time to go to the gym because they are too busy. 

Thankfully a lot of my clients train from home 3 times a week with minimal equipment. 

You see the thing is - you don't actually need hours in the gym to achieve your goals - especially if you're crazy busy. I also encourage women to make better choices if they are too busy to cook. And instead of scrolling on Social media - I set step targets for them (even if they scroll while they walk). 

You see - it's pretty simple. Try this out and let me know how it goes. 

P.s I'm looking for 5 more women who want to become bikini confident with restriction in the next 12 weeks.

We all lead such busy lifestyles these days. We give time to our families, our friends, and work and we are left with little to no time. 

It's so frustrating because you're trying to be a good friend, mother, daughter, sister, colleague, or employee. But what's left for you? Or maybe there is time? 

I've found that most people usually can find time. Maybe instead of an hour of Netflix we could swap it for a workout? Maybe instead of scrolling we could be walking? Or instead of picking up a takeaway on the way home from work, we could pick up a ready meal in a supermarket? The problem lies in trying to do too much.

Are you interested in learning about how you could commit to a programme even WITH limited time?

16,2021-12-28T21:01:04+0000,"How Kelly changed her habits and became more confident over 12 weeks. 

Kelly has been training approximately 5 years now. Her main goal was to feel better in herself. She was looking for a long term sustainable change - without restriction. 

Before we started working together Kelly had tried every 4 and 6 week challenge going and had achieved incredible results - that she couldn't sustain. She found herself unhappy in her clothes and she was sick of stopping and starting. 

She hesitated in starting because of the slow approach we use. And if she's honest, she thought it would be another failed attempt. But her unhappiness drove her to take action. 

'The new habits and coaching calls thought me how to increase my calories healthily'. She found a balance between training, nutrition and socialising. 'It was great' 

Fast forward 12 weeks and she feels so much happier and more confident.
'It made me feel 1 million times better knowing I was looking after myself' 

'Everyone should put themselves first and think about in the long run, this is going to make you feel better. The 12 weeks goes so fast.'

If you want results like Kelly - Dm me 'Kelly'.",14,2,VIDEO,FEED,https://video.cdninstagram.com/v/t50.2886-16/270200290_654385695595172_6301857002337527837_n.mp4?_nc_cat=106&vs=17947096138642136_2917877850&_nc_vs=HBksFQAYJEdPTHRHaENrbXU0S0tWTUNBQjNvb2hHT3NYUlhia1lMQUFBRhUAAsgBABUAGCRHRTNER3hEMEdiNllmbjBBQUdiWl9vUV9zTm9OYmtZTEFBQUYVAgLIAQAoABgAGwGIB3VzZV9vaWwBMRUAACa4%2FZWw%2FPflPxUCKAJDMywXQE3zMzMzMzMYEmRhc2hfYmFzZWxpbmVfMV92MREAdeoHAA%3D%3D&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=59939d&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InZ0c192b2RfdXJsZ2VuLjcyMC5mZWVkIn0%3D&_nc_ohc=m1mzgZSNJz4AX8DLUhV&_nc_ht=video.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfC5x0M62gyx9qQBHV4UHKlmTslyuwWPo_w7mB669-OaZA&oe=63D40A84&_nc_rid=f5296978e1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CYCnIEShYFP/,17897626499347819,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/270314955_994448961107401_2193177995466351212_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=UV8do5pd82YAX-bxQzJ&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfA1bBwYOrnxrjKLAL87tfgi-AwWEZ5X7-Ve2c5DxsDwlQ&oe=63D8113A,"[{'timestamp': '2022-01-23T10:25:45+0000', 'text': ""Jaysus who's this ride @kelly21irish 👐🏼👐🏼❤️"", 'username': 'djsmakeup', 'like_count': 2, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2022-01-23T10:26:57+0000', 'text': '@djsmakeup 😂😂😂😂', 'username': 'kelly21irish', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '18279923800031915'}]}, 'id': '17916733466199316'}]",,
17,2021-12-28T08:02:43+0000,"How I became stronger, happier and more confident and how you can too. 

When I started in the fitness industry I was a little lost. I was focused on how I looked. I was obsessed with having abs. I only ate 'clean' food mid week which led to weekend binges. My relationship with nutrition and fitness definitely was not a healthy one. 

I wasn't happy. Not in my body. Not in my mind. I genuinely couldn't imagine continuing my life with this level of restriction and I began to resent the gym 😢 

Then I stopped focusing so much on HOW I looked. I stopped looking for abs every time I walked by the mirror. I started to appreciate resistance training and I began focusing on how much stronger I was becoming. My goals changed. Performance based goals replaced the quest for abs and I found my love for exercise again. I found a balanced approach to nutrition. I still eat very healthy and nutritious but I no longer restrict myself. 

I no longer focus on HOW I look but WHAT my body can do. I wear bikinis now without dieting to get in them. I'm stronger and fitter than I've ever been and clothes sizes no longer dictate my life. I'm happier and healthier. I love the skin I'm in ❤ 

And that's why I created my Strong and Sassy Programme to help women become bikini confident year round without restrictions.

They are habits you can stick to NO MATTER WHAT the circumstances are. 

I usually recommend 3 of them.. 

3 things you can stick to every weekend.
For example - Drink 2 litres of water, walk 10,000 steps daily and 1 piece of fruit.

You may notice yourself cutting calories during the week and then all hell breaks lose at weekends and you're afraid that if you continue this way you'll never achieve that bikini body 😢 

It's so frustrating because you're really trying to make a change. What's actually causing this is a binge restrict cycle that you've developed over the years. We only know and understand nutrition at 2 levels - 'really good' or 'really bad' 

I've found the best solution to fix this is to SAY NO to the all or nothing approach - but this will require help. Accountability to someone who knows what they're talking about can definitely help with this. I've also found having non negotiables proves very helpful.

I went through a tough time in November (my Dad's Anniversary and Birthday, my friend at home got married late October, trials and tribulations of working for yourself). It was a bit of a whirlwind. But I'm 2 counselling sessions in and I can safely say I'm feeling a lot better ❤ 

I'm looking forward to spending Christmas with friends and family in Nelson Bay ❤🙏 I'm very lucky that work doesn't much feel like work and although I will have some downtime I will be working most of Christmas 🧑‍🎄 

It's my second 'summer' in Austrailia and it still feels weird wearing a bikini on Christmas Day 😅 I must say it does feel good to be bikini ready year round. And I love that my clients will be wearing a bikini with confidence this year. Some of them for 'THE FIRST TIME EVER'!!!!!! Mind blowing 🥳🤯 

Anyway I'm going to keep this short as I pack for holidays 💃 If you're interested in feeling as bikini confident as my clients.  DM me 👙

(Although these looking perfect would be pretty sweet 🤣)

Anyone want a mobility challenge - give this exercise a go 😲 I've went from a very unstable 5kg to a much improved 15kg SA OH Squat - still needs work but we're definitely seeing improvements 💪

I'm a HUGE believer in mobility and movement and honestly believe it's one of the main contributors to injury. 

🚨Fun Fact: I used to be really anti CrossFit - because I was young and naive.  But also because I believe in training pain free. If you have problems/niggles/issues don't wait until you're broken to be fixed. Look after your body, mind your body, continue to train 🙋‍♀️ From doing Crossfit for the last 2 years I understand my body, know my weak areas and work to make sure I can train as regularly as I want to. That means going to a physio once every 6 weeks - not because I'm injured but because I want to be injury free 🙌",70,2,VIDEO,REELS,https://video.cdninstagram.com/v/t50.33967-16/269477427_251276157072834_9195794299831334318_n.mp4?_nc_cat=101&vs=446921670225060_2059596787&_nc_vs=HBksFQAYJEdEUG1EeERDTlJYS2lPUUFBSzQxQXIweEJwNS1icV9FQUFBRhUAAsgBABUAGCRHRFBtRHhBNnFFRnBzWDBBQVBpSWVGcGVINEpTYnFfRUFBQUYVAgLIAQAoABgAGwGIB3VzZV9vaWwBMRUAACaWk6OHhozgPxUCKAJDMywXQDyF41P3ztkYEmRhc2hfYmFzZWxpbmVfMV92MREAdQAA&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=59939d&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InZ0c192b2RfdXJsZ2VuLjcyMC5jbGlwcyJ9&_nc_ohc=Q0jvIXUpfPQAX-MS49_&_nc_ht=video.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfDkwCqTIl5Tpf_W2C7YLuNYY1ngN5ijkUs-kpcVVM9KWg&oe=63D3DFB0&_nc_rid=9cd52ecf8c,https://www.instagram.com/reel/CXt033wBh8X/,18192377764181126,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/269819291_1262246904254465_1809665364686213240_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=jir3zpw8d1MAX8Pu1P9&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfAdmlKmHEZDqXzpGzHInEgV5CLzdDtdc_WO-fwVlLldPw&oe=63D89B2D,"[{'timestamp': '2021-12-21T02:08:55+0000', 'text': '😍🙌', 'username': 'advancedrejuvenationbondi', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2021-12-21T03:47:12+0000', 'text': '@advancedrejuvenationbondi is 😁❤', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '17858852087663018'}]}, 'id': '17909563118336802'}]",,

Rice and Oats are complex carbohydrates and give us a slow release in energy. Meanwhile, fruit are simple sugars and give us a quicker release. Carbohydrates is the body's main fuel for energy.

Avocado, cheese and eggs all contain fats. Good Fats are essential in the diet and can affect our ability to absorb fat soluble vitamins. We also need them for hormone function.

Creatine is one of the most vastly researched supplements and has been promoted in the fitness industry in the last few years. According to research, supplementation with creatine monohydrate has been shown to increase Skeletal muscle mass, lean body mass and muscle fibre size. Research also suggests past this and it may encourage healthy aging and benefit brain health. 

𝐃𝐨 𝐈 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐞?
Creatine supplementation can be hugely beneficial for athletic performance and studies have also showed it can have an impact on body composition (prolonged creatine ingestion inducing an increase in fat free mass). 

𝐃𝐨 𝐈 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐞?
Nope. 5g daily will suffice. (The idea to saturate the muscle is just to experience benefits sooner).
Increase water consumption when you start taking creatine.

Evidence does suggest post workout is superior to pre workout.

- Bloating - This is due to the muscles absorbing the water with the Creatine. Very common and usually subsides when the muscles are saturated.

But you may just need some help...

1. One of the most common mistakes I see people make is their lack of structure when it comes to training. Having a 'toned' goal or a strength/performance based goal is very difficult if you're participating in random spin classes or copying what other people do in the gym. If you're looking to change shape or get stronger - follow a progressive plan.

2. Consistency in EVERYTHING is 🔑 to success. Ask yourself - Can you see yourself doing this in a years time? If the answer is no, chances are you need to change something.

3. Unrealistic goals is a huge problem. Let's give the example of 'Having Abs' for a female. 
Most women have to sacrifice too much to achieve this goal. This leaves them A. Frustrated at not achieving it or B. Achieving it but hating life.
(Notice I said most females - some won't find this difficult at all but they are a minority).

4. Nutrition habits have changed. Again, ask yourself can you see yourself eating this way a year from now - if the answer is no - it's not going to be sustainable.

5. Stress is one of the most overlooked barriers to success. Just like you can't out exercise a bad diet. You can't achieve goals in an utterly stress fried body.

.
.
I use struggle with the fact that I don't conform to certain standards and expectations of a woman....
For example:
✔ I hate cleaning 
✔ I'm not an exceptional cook
✔ I don't bake
.
.
✔ I always wanted to wear comfy sportswear rather than dress up
✔ I didn't like being told what to do - by anyone 😅
.
.
✔ I prefer going to the gym rather than getting my hair done
✔ I'd rather a new pair of metcons over an expensive braclet 
✔ I'd pick a new tatoo over hair extensions
.
.
I struggled with this for years because  this is what I thought women did. I felt I was different. Possibly even there was something wrong with me 🙊
.
.
Now, I'm happy, confident and comfortable in myself - I realise I am who I am. I won't ever be a typical housewife (and @o_boyce is still with me 😅). I'd still rather have calluses than soft hands. And I WILL have a cleaner as I get older 😅 There is ABSOLUTELY nothing wrong with me. Maybe I am a little different but if we were all the same, the world would be a boring place 😅🙏

Anyone else ever have these feelings? 🤔

(Firstly, just note - the PT pros and cons are based on a general PT. I know and work with PTs who offer so much more. Secondly, the online coaching is based on MY online coaching. I know online coaches who provide a LOT less - but you pay peanuts, you get monkeys).
.
.
Here is my two cents. 
My Online coaching works best for people who:
✅ Need a high level of accountability-  which PT will rarely give you.
✅ Need nutrition education rather than another diet plan 🤦‍♀️
✅ Are busy and can't commit to Class times or can't even commit to joining a gym and need to train from home
✅ Need help working on their mindset

PT works best for people who:
✅ Need that face to face interaction
✅ Have injuries and need in person training

I want to state very strongly I am not recommending A vs B in any of the above. I just want to educate you all that sometimes health and fat loss goals can be different 🤷‍♀️ So while you may be eating 'Healthy' you may not actually be eating less and be in that negative energy balance you need to be in for fat loss to occur.
.
.
Also worth noting - my definition of health being less processed whole foods as opposed to lower calorie options 💫

Childcare Worker 

Original Goal: Initially I just wanted to lose some weight and gain confidence 

Results so far: This time last year I was stuck in a rut. I felt crap about how I looked. I stopped dressing up, wearing make up and I made excuses not to see my friends all because I didn’t like how I looked. Since beginning this programme, I have changed in so many ways. I gained confidence that I never thought I would. I learned about nutrition and I have started eating foods that this time last year I would have never eaten. I have learned how important sleep is for my health and also how to create a healthy mind. Amanda has helped me in ways I can’t even explain. I was so apprehensive about exercise but Amanda made it so easy to do during lockdown in my own house. More recently I have rejoined the gym after years of avoiding it. Amanda is so approachable and understanding and works with you and for you. The group element is so uplighting as we all support each other through the good times and the bad.

1. Amino Acids are proteins building blocks and we NEED these for recovery. Remember recovery is not only essential if you train, our bodies recover every single day.

2. Satiety - every sit down to eat 3 chicken breasts? Doubtful because protein rich foods are so filling. They also help stabilise our blood sugars and reduce cravings. So get your protein in 👊

3. Thermic Effect from Food (TEF) - Did you know that TEF has the same effect on our TDEE as purposeful exercise? 🤔 Did you know protein actually requires more energy to break down than fats or carbohydrates? 🤔 So double whammy here 👊

Sport always helped me value my body. But unfortunately as a young girl, sport wasn't enough. I cared deeply about how I looked and I constantly tried to change it. I was always slim but I had such a distorted idea of what I looked like in my head. I always wanted to be leaner. And I was willing to get there in very unhealthy manners.

Fast forward 10 years 👋
Lifting weights and Crossfit has changed my whole view on my body. I am no longer obsessed with how I look. Like everyone I've days where I feel amazing and days where I feel like a bag of 💩. But HOW I look doesn't hugely affect me.

Quite often people think you need to do more to achieve your goals. And in a lot of cases that is true - more exercise, more water, better nutrition. But for some actually less is more. 
.
.
Everyone has their problem areas. Some people nail nutrition and exercise and can't understand why they can't lose weight - while their bodies are in chronic sleep deprivation 🤦‍♀️ Others weigh in the week before their period and can't understand why their weight fluctuates. Others would rather take a supplement than eat real food 🙈
.
.
These are some of the elements to think about when it comes to your goals - in no particular order 👊
.
.
My own Experience 
- I'm excellent with training and drinking water, I'm very good with nutrition and my sleep is decent. Performance is my goal. But my social life is also heightening so I can't push my training as hard as I was during lockdown. I'm also very cautious and work with my body as opposed to against it 🙏🙌

Nutrition and exercise are not the only 2 elements you can control. If you have those nailed why not look at other areas? 🤔

'𝐈 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐛𝐞 𝐝𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠'

Me too 🙋‍♀️ Nothing is OFF LIMITS with my programme!

'𝐈 𝐜𝐚𝐧'𝐭 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝟓 𝐝𝐚𝐲𝐬 𝐚 𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐤 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠'

That's ok because only 10% of my clients train 5 times a week throughout the year 🤣

This programme works around you NOT you work around it. The results are slower but they are so much more sustainable. I want to help more and more women become the healthiest, most confident versions of themselves. 

If this sounds like you, Dm me 'Start'.

Honestly, if fruit is your biggest problem re nutrition you're doing pretty darn well 🤣 
.
.
Unless you are diabetic, have issues with glucose levels or insulin or are preparing for a body building competition- fruit is not going to be something you need to worry about 🤦‍♀️
.
.
Not only are they an abundant source of vitamins and minerals but some can even add to our hydration status 👌 As well as that they contain fibre and help add to a healthy gut 💩
Try vary your fruit as much as possible to get an array of healthy benefits 🤗

I'm pretty sure abs are not all that representative of fitness. And since when did one body shape become associated with fitness.

.
.
Here's another addition to the never ending list of ways to be a healthier version of yourself 🙌
.
.
Mindful = Not Mindless
.
.
1. Eat with intent - savour food.

2. Chew your food - did you know you should be chewing your food about 32 times before swallowing? 🙈

3. Eat at a table if possible - avoid eating of your knees in poor posture, avoid standing 

4. Give yourself time - 5 minutes is RARELY enough. Give yourself the time you deserve to take a lunch break

5. Limit distractions - no phones or tvs while eating.
.
.
A lot of the time when we experience stomach discomfort - cramping, bloating etc we put it down to certain foods. Unfortunately our environment and our focus can quite often be a factor and one that is totally overlooked 🥴

‼️I'm looking for 5 ladies who want to feel amazing in:
 A. Bikini or 
 B. Their Christmas Party Dress
I've released spaces for my 90 Day Strong and Sassy programme for November ‼️
.
Feel like you've tried everything and still see no results? Here's 3 reasons my coaching programme could work for you: 

1. I educate women on nutrition. I don't give meal plans but actually teach you the importance of nutrient dense food. I help you calculate calories and understand the foods you need to fuel your body. I'm also a big advocate of including foods you actually enjoy! 

2. Want to be able to lift your suitcase with ease when lockdown finishes? Want to perform a push up? Want to become a strong, independent female?
I focus on resistance training and encourage women to become the strongest they can be. 

3. I help women become the best versions of themselves. Confidence comes from the inside out and I help women find that sassy female that's hiding inside. 

✔Imagine this Christmas feeling Self confident and happy
as opposed to 
✖Self conscious and miserable

〰️ Take Control of the situation this year and feel amazing at Christmas. Now is the time to start 👊

The fitness industry is becoming saturated. There is so much conflicting information it's overwhelming to even know where to start. I want to stand out and not fade into the same mould.
.
.
I'm pretty safe though because:

❎ I won't be that 'hot' fitness model - although leave some 🔥 if you love the posts of my sweaty red head
❎ I won't be posing in lingerie to get thousands followers - although I do look good in Lingerie 😜
❎ I won't be putting videos up of myself doing 10 variations of crunches or booty band workouts.
.
.
I actually struggle to find time to put up educational content these days because I am so busy with my clients. All my time, effort and education goes into helping everyone of them. They have invested their time and money in me and I'm so proud of the work we do together ❤
.
.
Anyway, I'm going to be different to a lot of other fitness accounts - I'm not going to say its just as simple as 'Eat Less, Move More✌'. 
Sorry unfortunately I just don't think it is.
.
.
My hierarchy begins with stress reduction - why?
.
.
Well because stress in all shapes and sizes leads to incredible problems in the body. 
Example: Stress of too little calories - Can lead to hormonal disruptions which can lead to amenorrhoea which can lead to infertility. Too little calories and poor food quality can lead to micronutrient deficiencies and injury. 
Stress can be as simple as drinking too much caffeine or as severe as overwhelm. Add up all the daily stresses in your life and see how many there are😱
.
.
Sleep should be AS IMPORTANT as exercise and nutrition combined - end of story😴
.
.
Nutrition and food quality come next.🥦
.
.
Exercise in general should technically come next but this is my pyramid so I'm going to do what I believe is most important - irrespective of goals 🏋‍♀️
.
Lastly, individual variance. Have a condition or a goal? Follow all the below first and foremost and the individuality should come last

💥I educate women on nutrition, while helping them become stronger from the inside out🤤💥

But what makes my coaching different: 

1. I'm a qualified nutritionist- studying nutrition in college actually means damn all because nutrition is constantly changing and we're always learning. BUT I am more qualified to give advice than most people out there. 

2. I DON'T focus on Fat Loss - I'm one of the few coaches out there that don't promote weight loss. That doesn't mean weight loss is not a bi-product. But I focus on your why and help you work on that. 

3. I've never had a transformation, I've never conformed to fads, I've always been true to myself. I've always been fit.  But that doesn't mean I don't understand - I've years of experience and have helped hundreds of people along the way. 

4. I genuinely care. I know all coaches say that. But I actually mean it. My mission in life is to genuinely help as many people as possible. I want women to see how incredible they are and not base their worth on a scale number or clothes size. I want women to become self confident and empowered 🙏

That is EXACTLY why I think I'm different. 

If you're interested in feeling better in yourself, becoming more educated on nutrition and getting stronger- 

DM 'Coach'.

Sick of chicken and broccoli? 🤔
.

You will quickly run out of ideas if you try to change whole meals so why not change up the sides 💁‍♀️
.
.
From my experience, people tend to like certain foods. If you stick with the foods you like, you're more likely to stick with it 🙏 
.
.
So my advice:
- Change the vegetables - not just the type but how you cook them - stir fry, boil, steam, roast. 

- Change the carb source - sick of brown rice? Add quinoa or cous cous! Sick of potato, try sweet potato.

- Rotate Week 1 - Chicken and pork based meals. Week 2 - Tofu and tuna based meals. Week 3 - Turkey & Salmon based meals. Week 4 - Prawn & Beef based meals. And start the cycle again 🙌

.
.
Lets be totally clear on the context. It was training WITH an injury. Not training THROUGH an injury. Very different. 
.
.
However, it is not uncommon to train through an injury either. I want to be clear here. I am NOT telling you to train with an injury. This is very individual dependent and requires advice from a professional I.e Doctor, physio etc.
.
.
✅Training with an injury 

👉 Anyone who knows me, knows how much of an advocate I am of this. When I injure lower body, upper body is still very much manageable, however, I am careful not to put too much pressure on affected area 

👉 Mental Health - I don't know about the rest of you but mental health is one of my main reasons for training so if I had to sit still I'd cry 😩 

👉 Socialising - It can be a tough time going through an injury. If you are a sports player it can be so isolating 😢 Being able to do something in th gym, in a class or with your team can have a huge impact on your mindframe ❤ 

➡️ Training through an injury 

🚫 Only do under advice from your healthcare professional (But a little bit of important info is there actually is evidence to suggest you can) 

✅ Nutrition with an injury
⛔ Most overlooked aspect of recovery in my opinion 

👉 Fats are anti inflammatory and a vital part of the healing process 

👉 Protein as ALWAYS is King 🤴 

👉 Calories will need to be adjusted for activity levels - But do NOT dramatically cut calories. This is where a lot of people go wrong. The body needs food and fuel to repair and recover so while you may not be as active don't underestimate the importance of fuel. 

➡️Remember Recovery does not just mean 'rest'

.
.
'Ah it definitely is so much easier for me...'
.
.
Then I think back 🤔
.
.
👉 I was the PICKIEST eater you can ever imagine. Eating healthily did NOT come easy to me. It took years and years. Then I went through periods of super strict clean eating which lead to binging. To have found such a good balance and relationship with food was not easy at all. But we've got there 🙌

👉 It's very easy to see I love exercise. Its not a struggle for me. But that doesn't mean I haven't put in work. Serious work. Not just in the last few years but since I was a teenager. 12 years of training - with injuries, and through adversity. So while the intention of training is easy for me, the work I have put in hasn't been.

👉 It's clear I have never struggled with my weight. I haven't had your typical 'transformation'. I still put that one down to my consistency over the years. But just because I've never carried weight doesn't mean I've never struggled with body image & self confidence. I've done a lot of work on my relationship with my self esteem 🙏And I'm finally in a place where I am happy no matter what I look like ❤

👉 I have sacrificed. I have been disciplined. I have failed. I have accepted boredom and discomfort and I spend a lot of time outside my comfort zone 🙈

Original Goal:
I originally joined to lose weight and gained confidence in myself.
.
.
I am a completely different person after working with Amanda - I have unreal encouragement and constant support. I have lost weight and gained so much knowledge. The biggest change is I am so much happier from the inside out. I no longer feel guilty for having treats at the weekend or having a few drinks because thats just a small part of my life. Consistency is key.  I don't think I've ever heard of a coach who cares as much for their clients well being as Amanda does.

.
Please be aware all cycles are different and the advice I give is general. 
.
.
Training with my cycle had been game changer for me. Now luckily I am in a position where I have control over my training. I can reduce frequency and intensity when I need to. If you are an athlete, you may find this more difficult. But I cannot recommend enough to train with your body as opposed to against it. You should be able to speak to a coach or trainer about training intensity at different times. 
.
.
This really could be a game changer for your training and your overall body composition. 💪💪💪

.
.
Pregnancy was once considered a reason to stop all exercise and eat for two. Which often led to excessive weight gain, gestational diabetes, pre eclampsia, difficult births and difficulty with weight loss post partum. Now, obviously pregnancy is massively different for everyone. Unfortunately there is no one size fits all. But the information I'm giving is general recommendations. If you have any further questions. It is probably worth talking it over with your doctor or other medical professional ☺️
.
.
Exercise:
-Studies have shown that exercise during pregnancy can actually lead to easier birthing and healthy weight gain during pregnancy.
-It is also thought to be beneficial for post partum weight loss.
-Guidelines for exercise encourage women to stick with similar exercises prior to pregnancy. Light Resistance based training is highly recommended.
- Adaptations may be needed through different trimesters such as: Not lying on your back for too long or overhead extension exercises may need to be removed. This is very dependent on individuals
- Hiit training may not be recommended after trimester 1 - again very dependent on the individual and their training history but it will become a lot harder
- Light exercise like walking can possibly be done the whole way up until due date
- The main take home point from this is: Exercise during pregnancy is encouraged. Everyone's levels, capabilities and pregnancies are different so go with how you're feeling. Don't over exert yourself. And talk with your coach and doctor 🙏
.
.
Nutrition
- This idea of eating double for two is non sense 🙈
- Calories shouldn't even be increased in first trimester. Daily calories should be increased by about 300Cals in 2nd trimester and 500Cals in 3rd Trimester.
- There may be food aversions or food cravings during pregnancy - this is totally normal.
- Try to stick with whole nutritious foods
- Supplements include: Folic Acid, Vitamin D, Iron and Omega 3 Fatty acids. But talk to your doctor or health are consultant before taking any of these.

I love training 

I love eating healthy 

I love being productive. 

I love rising before sunrise. 

I also love drinking too much sangria with my friends at a picnic & making some of the 'unhealthy' choices that no one thinks I make 😅 

I lived my 20s as an athlete. I trained like an athlete, ate like an athlete, had the social life of an athlete. I can't say I slept like one because I was obsessed with productivity and yano sleep is for the weak 🤦‍♀️ 

Honestly at 30 in Australia I have finally striked the perfect balance in my life ❤ 

I currently describe myself as - loves to train but also enjoys a margarita 🍸

.
.
When people say to me they 'want to lose weight', more often than not - it's fat loss they are actually seeking. And there is a difference 👆
.
.
Weight loss is a combination of fat, muscle and water. When people go on very restrictive diets they often see a huge scale shift on week 1 due to a reduction in total body water - as opposed to fat loss. 
.
.
If people focus solely on scale loss unfortunately there is likely to be muscle mass loss - which is what we don't want. As far as I'm aware some diet clubs actually discourage resistance training as it will lead to muscle gain (and essentially an increase on the scales) 🙈
.
.
Ladies, please please understand smaller ≠ happier 🚫
.
.
If someone is overweight/obese, weight loss should be the goal to a healthier overall body composition 🙏

Anyone else - Fat Loss is what you should be seeking 👆

.
Feel like you've tried everything and still see no results? Here's 3 reasons my coaching programme could work for you: 

1. I educate women on nutrition. I don't give meal plans but actually teach you the importance of nutrient dense food. I help you calculate calories and understand the foods you need to fuel your body. I'm also a big advocate of including foods you actually enjoy! 

2. Want to be able to lift your suitcase with ease when lockdown finishes? Want to perform a push up? Want to become a strong, independent female?
I focus on resistance training and encourage women to become the strongest they can be. 

3. I help women become the best versions of themselves. Confidence comes from the inside out and I help women find that sassy female that's hiding inside.

Fat gets a bad rep. 
Sure it is 9Kcal per gram but it is an essential part of a balanced fat. 
.
.
Fats provide us with energy, makes up our cell membranes of our brain and nervous system. Fats are necessary to transport vitamins A,D,E and K and make and balance certain hormones.
.
.
Dietary Fat can be found in 2 forms:
Saturated – mainly found in animal products like meat, dairy, eggs, coconut
Unsaturated – found in marine sources like fish oils, as well as nuts, seeds and vegetable oils
.
. 
For years saturated fat was thought to be associated with higher risk of Cardiovascular Disease and so it was deemed as ‘unhealthy’ or ‘bad for you’. The problem with saturated fat was not the actual fat itself but rather the increased consumption of processed food or the large quantities of saturated fat products. Saturated fat helps increase the cholesterol production in the body which is an essential part of metabolism and in the production of steroid hormones. So saturated fat should feature in our diet, just maybe don’t latter every meal in butter.
.
. 
Unsaturated fats are made up of mono and polyunsaturated fats.  These contain our omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids. Omega 3 fatty acids open our airways and blood vessels. They reduce our blood lipids and cholesterol and lower inflammation and pain. Omega 6 fatty acids do the opposite. Both are needed in the body, without both we wouldn’t heal or recover from exercise. The problem with Western diets is that we don’t have the proper ratios. We are at about 10:1 where we should be at 2:1 (omega 6/omega 3).
.
. 
Low fat diets were a fad a few years ago. While people reduced calories, they increased their intake of processed foods. Diets lacked fats and fat soluble vitamins so instead of being healthier people were losing weight but were not healthier.
.
. 
Fats are an essential part of any healthy diet. Be aware that they are very calorie dense so portion control may be important and don’t opt for processed versions. Enjoy them as part of a balanced lifestyle.

Original goal:
To become a healthier and happier version of me. To build better habits with food and exercise. Also to gain confidence and comfort in my own skin. 

Results so far:
I’m delighted with how far I have come since I started 6 months ago. I have definitely become a healthier version of myself. Becoming happier and more confident and comfortable in myself is a journey for me which I am well and truly on.  However, I could not have done it without the coaching and support of Amanda. Amanda has thought me things that I know will remain with me forever, the changes she has helped me make and the habits she has helped me build were never drastic changes…they were changes made over a period of time and at a pace that suited me.  The effort Amanda goes to for all of her clients and the community she builds is fantastic!

A lot of you think I'm this crazy lunatic who loves torture and just enjoys training extraordinarily hard....

You're actually pretty spot on 😅

✔ I love the sense of accomplishment of finishing a workout I didn't even think was possible to finish
✔ I love the feeling of hitting a pb or lifting a weight I never even dreamed I could lift
✔ I love those sick workouts people hate 😈

I'm sure most of you are aware I don't train for aesthetics. And even though performance is my main goal WHEN I train - the PRIMARY reason I train is for my head 🧠

Training has honestly helped me through the toughest times in my life. 👉 It helped me when I lost my Dad
👉 It helped me when I struggled with taking on too much

And it's helped me through this lockdown. 
✔It's given me a routine when I lost mine.
✔It's given me a social connection by allowing me to train with friends
✔It has given me purpose - during a difficult time

I'm sick of women thinking they need lose weight, eat crazy low calories, and exercise excessively
NO ONE needs to do this. NO ONE.

What you think you need and what you actually need are 2 very different things in my experience.

✔ Patience
✔ Consistency

✔I dieted before holidays just to make sure I was as lean as possible. 
✔I was so self conscious 🙈

I'm booking a Christmas trip away with a big gang of girls without a 2nd thought ❤🙏 NOTHING to do with how my body looks. I don't worry about those things anymore. Its not to say I wake up every morning and think WOAH I have a BANGING body 😅 Because I don't. But I just don't let what I look like on the outside define me 🙏

✅ Being strong enough to be independent (even though I plan on having @o_boyce every step of the way 🤣)
✅ Being able to exercise with my children
✅ Being able to walk upstairs, out and about as a Granny
✅ Preventing illness and injury

If this is your goal, you need to start laying down the foundations now. It's never too late BUT the sooner you start the better those foundations are 😜

.
.
1. Health is so much more important than weight

2. Stop trying to be perfect. Perfection doesn't exsist

3. Relax a little. Don't stress so much. Good things come to people who work but remember there's a thing called life that needs to be enjoyed

4. Problems aren't solved at the bottom of a vodka bottle

5. Fitness is NOT about being skinny. Fitness is not about abs.

6. Eat your bloody vegetables and stop being so damn picky. It feels so much better on your body and you'd have so much more energy

7. Make up isn't life. You are beautiful, stop hiding yourself with layers of foundation and baggy hoodies.

8.Appreciate everyone in your life. You think they will always be around. Unfortunately that's not the case 💔 

Although these are visual pictures this is not a physical transformation. I love my body not for how it looks but what it can do.

‼️I'm looking for 5 ladies who want to become strong and confident while eating the foods they enjoy‼️
.
.
Feel like you've tried everything and still see no results? Here's 3 reasons my coaching programme could work for you: 

1. I educate women on nutrition. I don't give meal plans but actually teach you the importance of nutrient dense food. I help you calculate calories and understand the foods you need to fuel your body. I'm also a big advocate of including foods you actually enjoy! 

2. Want to be able to lift your suitcase with ease when lockdown finishes? Want to perform a push up? Want to become a strong, independent female?
I focus on resistance training and encourage women to become the strongest they can be. 

3. I help women become the best versions of themselves. Confidence comes from the inside out and I help women find that sassy female that's hiding inside. 

I know sometimes people are afraid to make a long term commitment so this kickstarter may be exactly what you need to start your health and fitness journey with me. Did I also mention the incredible community that comes with it?

19,2021-08-30T09:01:45+0000,"🎯 Nutrition - Hierarchy of Importance 🎯
.
.
Here's is my nutrition triangle. This is not a standard pyramid, it's mostly just my opinion 😁
.
.
Diet is defined as the kinds of food a person habitually eats. No diet will ever be successful if someone cannot successfully stick to it and be consistent with it. And for this reason, it is my bread and butter. It is the most important element when it comes to nutrition.
.
.
I am a nutritionist so Food Quality is my next most important element. I know in terms of energy balance it is as simple as calories in versus calories out but I just cannot educate people and say that
Food quality doesn't matter. If I didn't care about my clients and I just cared about transformation photos I could give someone a calorie calculator and say 'Here once it's within your calories it doesn't matter what the meals include'. Maybe not for body composition (questionable) but certainly for long term health 🤦‍♀️
.
.
Then, I put calories. Calories do matter but to me food quality matters more. As I've said, this is opinion. At the end of the day, it is an energy balance equation so I can't disregard them but just be aware of how inaccurate logging and tracking can be. Just be informed 👊
.
.
Technically that should be macronutrients but I'm putting protein as the king 🤴 Although I do feel very strongly about good balance so please don't disregard carbs and fats 😬
.
.
Lastly, comes supplements. Supplements should always be an addition.

Did I miss anything 🤔

What happens if you don't lose weight one week? Does it undo all the hard work you've done? All the consistent effort you've made. All the new habits you've built. Or what if your weight plateaus? Does this mean you quit and give up? 🤷‍♀️
.
.
We are all impatient humans. And we want to be rewarded for our hard work. And that's fair. But success does not happen over night in any industry so why would weight loss be different. 🚫
.

Consistency is key. Finding a method that works for your goals but that you also enjoy - making it sustainable. And don't forget about all the good habits you are making. If you made one good habits each week for a year, that'd be 52 good habits. ✅ Keep up the great work 🥳

When people said to Arnold Schwarzenegger 
'Oh but I don't want to look like you.'

He replied:
'Don't worry. You never will.'
.
.
Let me tell you. Building muscle is BLOODY HARD. You don't just wake up one day and 'are bulky' 😅😅😅
.
.
I've spent YEARS improving myself and getting stronger, fitter and healthier. That is my goal. So don't think after lifting afew weights you're going to gain 10kg of muscle and look 'bulky'. And honestly, most people will NEVER EVER train as hard as I train 😅 
.
.
But let me also tell you. Majority of the photos I take are mid or post training when I have a serious pump. In normal clothes, I'm a normal size 8-10 female. I don't have jacked quads or a shoulder vein 😅 (Even though I'd be happy to walk around like that)
.

Moral of the story: most people will never train hard enough to get bulky. Most people don't walk round jacked 😅 The 'toned' look you want is actually muscle - so if you say you want to be 'toned' and don't want muscle you're actually contradicting yourself 😅

.
.
1. Consistency - I make sure every single one of my clients can be consistent with their goals. How? Because each of their programmes and habits are tailored to them.
Eileen mother of 3 barely has enough time to do 2 sessions a week when the kids are off school so why would I give her 5 sessions a week like Mary (a student)? Consistency is key. Each individual is different. Consistency looks different to everyone, but it is the key to every successful fitness journey.
.
.
2. Why? - I told you my why last week. My why is to be a role model. Everyone else has their own why - but unless you know yours and REALLY REALLY care about it, you're probably going no where.
.
.
3. Unrealistic Goals - 
Abs is the perfect example. 
Apart from the tiny minority of genetically gifted people - Abs are not that easy to achieve. Firstly, people don't want to sacrifice what it takes to achieve them. Secondly, being at that low body fat (especially for a woman) is very difficult and unsustainable. So set yourself more realistic, attainable goals.
.
.
4. Impatient - Look I'm impatient too. I get it. But honestly, if you're putting a time frame on your health and fitness journey - you're probably already off to a bad start. You should be looking at the long term - in a few months, a few years etc. It can be good to do a little kick-starter but your fitness journey should never have an end date 👊
.
.
5. You don't have a road map to your goals - This one is easily the most fixable one. Why do you keep trying to do it alone? There are people out there who can help. 

✅People like me who have cared about health and fitness their whole lives. 
✅People like me who have helped 100s of women already.
✅ People like me who have the qualifications to back it up.
.

If you:
- want to stop using excuses and start seeing results 
- are sick of stopping and starting 
- are serious about changing

3,2021-08-18T08:26:00+0000,"✴ My 𝙬𝙝𝙮? 
.
.
If you haven't already noticed I feel very passionate about helping people. 
.
.
I too, disliked my body image, under fuelled and exercised to burn calories. I too did endless amounts of cardio and crunches in a bid to find abs. And guess what, nothing changed. How I felt about myself didn't change one single bit. Even when I was a size 6 and probably <18% BF with visible abs, I still wasn't happy. 
.
.
And you won't be either, unless you deal with what's going on in your head and understand the 
Importance of your why. 
.
.
My 𝙬𝙝𝙮 is to be a role model 🙋‍♀️ I want younger girls to look up to me. I want peers to understand the message I am preaching. I want older women to see that fad diets and restriction is NOT the answer. I want Dad's to say 'You should listen to that Mc Loone one' (if you know you know 😅).
.
.
My 𝙬𝙝𝙮 is to help as many women as I can become the best versions of themselves. 
💥I want to educate women that you can still enjoy the food you like and be happy. 
💥I want women to see how empowering it is to become physically stronger. 
💥I want to help women see how incredible they are and stop focusing so much on how they look on the outside and see what they have to offer from the inside. 
💥I want to see confidence radiating from the women I work with. 
.
.
I truely believe I was put on this planet for 3 reasons:
1. To help as many people as physically possible.
2. To become the fittest and healthiest version of myself
3. To have loads of animals 
.

Amanda is also such an amazing role model for women with her own fitness goals.

In Fact if anything I think you're a little more courageous 
🤩🤩🤩
.
.
You are not expected to know everything. That's why people have occupations with the relevant knowledge and skills to help 👌
.
.
💥 If you are a student, unsure of your path. Please talk to a career guidance teacher.
💥 If you are unsure of your career and thinking about changing everything for a different route. Maybe you could see a life coach.
💥 If you are sick. See a doctor.
💥 If you are having mental health issues, a counsellor may be an option
💥 If you're having car troubles, go to a mechanic.
💥 If your phone isn't working, bring it to a phone shop.
.
.
See the trend???
.
.
Once upon a time I thought I was totally independent. I didn't want to ask for help from anyone!!! But then I realised, I can't do it all alone and actually support and guidance is the best thing I could get. NOW, I ask for help all the time. From family, friends, and colleagues. I have a coach. If my mental health is affecting me I call someone for help. One of the best things I ever did was see a life coach ❤
.
.
Why is it so hard for people to see the same applies to training and nutrition? 🥴🥴🥴 You could be spending weeks, months or even years trying to do it alone? 🙈 Wasting your time and money in the process. If you aren't qualified in the area. YOU CAN ALWAYS ASK FOR HELP 🙏 Please please stop making poor nutrition choices based on what Google told you. Stop wasting time trying to 'shred belly fat' based on a free workout Susan gave you.

Ask for help. Stop wasting your time. I'm literally just a phone call away.

I got this tattoo just before moving to Austrailia. I certainly would never say I had a bad life - but I wasn't FULLY happy. I had to make changes. 
💥The first and best thing I did was quit football. This is not a stab at anyone playing or all the amazing people I know through GAA. But it was no longer bringing me joy. If anything, it was an added stress to my life. 
💥The second thing I had to do which was a hell of a lot harder was to try and heal a very strained relationship. 
💥And the third choice I made was Austrailia. 
.
.
Let me tell you we all have these tough decisions to make. Yours won't be the same as mine, but honestly if something is not adding to your life and is bringing you so much misery - YOU HAVE THE POWER TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!!
.
.
✴Maybe it's the job you dread going into every day
✴ For some it's a relationship going nowhere 
✴ Countless people are unhappy in their body and doing absolutely NOTHING about it 😭 
.
.
YOU HAVE CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE. THESE ARE CHOICES YOU ARE MAKING EVERY DAY. 
.
.
Honestly, I can happily say, if I died tomorrow. I would be dying with memories. I would be leaving behind a life I am PROUD of 🙏

Could you say the same? 🤔

These days we are busy. Sometimes maybe even too busy to food prep 🙈

I've been there 🙋‍♀️ I used to eat on the go ALL THE TIME. If I didn't have Tupperware I had to make do with what I could get in the shops 🙌 I can promise you though, you do NOT have to revert to delis and unhealthy options just because you're not prepared 👊

Here are some examples of meals I used to eat on the go. (P.S I still eat a lot of these types of meals because convenience is key for me 😜) but luckily now I get @hunger_gains_ - convenience and amazing tasting healthy food. Win win 🥳🙋‍♀️

All of these require minimal time and effort. And you knit pick and say 'Packet bought chicken isn't the healthiest?' Well Susan... it's better than that sausage roll you reached for last week 🙈😅

🧪Let’s do a little experiment and see how you go:
 
🤔Are your friends and social network fit and healthy? Or are your meet ups all limited to the takeaways/pub/eating out? 🥡🍷

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦Does your family live a fit and healthy lifestyle?

👴🏼👵Are your parents fit and healthy?

If your parents and/or partner is overweight or unhealthy the research shows that you’re much more likely to also be so.

Does your work 📉encourage or facilitate a healthy atmosphere – healthy food options and/or end of trip facilities/gym access?
Are your colleagues in great shape?🏋️‍♀️
 
⭕️Your environment is EVERYTHING. Within your environment you will have conscious and unconscious biases and make assumptions about life in general based on what’s happening closest to you.
 
🧩If you’re in a circle of friends/family and work where health isn’t a key cornerstone… is it any wonder that you have No Motivation, No Plan and No Consistency?

A study was done to see how women would react to someone entering their home and attacking them - major result to the study was:
'Women would not put up too much of a fight'.

Then mothers were asked the same question BUT the attacker, was attacking their children -
Mothers went ballistic - why would you even ask that question?
Major result to the study was: Mothers would die for their children.

✅ Kindness has been shown to increase happiness - Not just acts of kindness but actually thinking about being kinder.

✅ Spending money on other people - check out the book 'Happy Money'. 

✅ Having more time - studies have shown that people who have more free time and less money are happier than those who have more money and less time

✅ Social connection increases happiness - What I miss most in Lockdown 😢

✅ Meditation causes increased positive emotions. Not just at the time of meditation but it has lasting effects afterwards. Meditation changes and strengthens the brain!

✅ Exercise - a study done by Babayak et al concluded that exercise alone was more effective in reducing depression rates than medication

✅ Sleep - Enough said 😴

Is it obvious I'm currently studying the Science of Well Being? 😃

Anyway I get a lot of people asking me how am I always so positive and happy. Well honestly I have nailed A LOT of the above 👆👆👆

Obviously we know exercise is not something I struggle with. Sleep is just as important and I meditate every night before bed. I have always been an extrovert and I thrive off social connections. I truly believe I'm a very kind person and I get a genuine kick off 'spending money on people'. I have NOT always had time. But since moving to Austrailia things have changed. That's not to say I'm not busy. It just means I spend my time wisely and have time for the things I enjoy in life ❤🙏 I've never been money driven so enjoying my job and having time to travel and do the things  I want to do are what makes me happy 🥰

Feel like you've tried everything and still see no results? Here's 3 reasons my coaching programme could work for you: 

1. I educate women on nutrition. I don't give meal plans but actually teach you the importance of nutrient dense food. I help you calculate calories and understand the foods you need to fuel your body. I'm also a big advocate of including foods you actually enjoy! 

2. Want to be able to lift your suitcase with ease when lockdown finishes? Want to perform a push up? Want to become a strong, independent female?
I focus on resistance training and encourage women to become the strongest they can be. 

3. I help women become the best versions of themselves. Confidence comes from the inside out and I help women find that sassy female that's hiding inside.

In recent days:

1.I've spoken to one woman and she has had people say to her 'Sure why do you need a coach?'. 
Why the hell not? 🤔 We are so quick to promote counselling for our mental health but you promote coaching and it can only be used for someone overweight? 🤔 
Well I'm here to say I don't discriminate. I don't believe coaching is only for people looking to lose weight. 

2. I spoke to two women struggling with their change in appearance. Gaining weight is sometimes optimal for health. But you know what, it can be hard. And sometimes you need support ❤ A coach can help with that.
.
.
Coaching is not a fitness programme or a diet plan. It's a lifestyle change.

I was so obsessed with comparing myself to other women. I was so certain if I looked like other people I would be happier in my own body. I was indoctrinated. I used to look up Owen's exes for Christ sake and compare myself 😅 (Just so you know if any of you follow me 😅). 
.
.
So how did I get to present day Amanda? My God it took time and a lot of effort. Took some counselling too 🤟 Becoming happy comfortable and confident in my body took gratitude, talking to myself and listening to a lot of positive self help books. 
.
.
I started to appreciate how incredible my body is. Not for what it looks like but what it can do. And after that changed, so did my whole outlook.
.
.
I still get a little envious (of a good tan 😍😍😍) but I'm pretty darn happy with my body. I no longer compare it to smaller waist sizes. I'm not upset any more that I have a little pouch (that's my happiness pouch).

I'm proud of my body. And you should be too ❤

I work really hard to give women what they actually need. In reality, this looks like:
👆 Nutrition Education - stop with food guilt, stop with binge and restrict cycle, eating foods they actually enjoy

👆 Resistance training - women think they need to burn more calories and HIIT style workouts are the only way to do this ✖ Resistance based training changes our body shape and increases our BMR.

👆 Accountability - we all need accountability. Myself included. It helps us stay on track but also it gives us a support line. When my clients are struggling is when I tell them to reach out more.

👆 Community - I've always worked better as a team. I can train alone easily but know I've people to report back to and a team I don't want to let down, this is very important to me. I'm not just creating an online programme here but a community of women supporting one another ❤🙌

Sometimes it doesn't need a name. And what about bipolar and schizophrenia?

August 2018
This photo was taken during a time in my life when my mental was at it's WORST - you wouldn't think it would you 🤷‍♀️ I was having an absolute ball with my friends - drinking way too much to forget the fact that my life was in turmoil. 
.
.
The day after this photo was taken, I woke up to a call from a stranger to say my mother had been taken to hospital (physical injuries as a result of her mental health problems). 
At the time, I was running a gym, commuting, looking after my mother, and playing inter county football. 
.
.
This is not a pity party. It's not to say I've had life tougher than others. 
Thankfully, I'm well on the other side of that period of my life 🙏 
.
.
What I just want to do is raise awareness that it's not always black and white. And sometimes, you have NO CLUE what someone is going through 🙏
.
.
So firstly, BE KIND ALWAYS ❤ You literally have NO IDEA how much someone may need it.
Secondly, check in on your strong friends too.
.
.
People in Syndey, these are tough times. But look at our Irish counterparts, look at how they managed ❤ We got this. And never ever be afraid to reach out, even if it's just for a moan down the phone 🙏
I'm definitely always here ❤🙏

I lost my love of football about 3 years before I quit💔💔💔
.
.
When I first started, skill was priority. Which I had none of 😂 But I still had the craic. It was so much fun. Even though I never got a game, the sidelines were hopping when I was around 🎶🎶🎶
Between the ages of 18 and 25, fitness was priority 🏃‍♀️Finally my lucky break 🙌 I may not be able to kick a ball, but I was fit 🙋💪 I enjoyed football so much during these years ❤️ And thankfully, they were my best years performance wise and I had a few medals to show for it too 🏅🏅🏅
.
.
But the last 3 years the game changed. Or maybe it was just my mentality. I had sacrificed so much for so long, maybe I was just sick of doing that 🤔 Or maybe I just didn't have the same winning mentality others have. 🤷‍♀️ I cannot do 'whatever it takes' to win. Its just not in me 🚫 And as for sacrifice. It used to be a 2 week drinking ban which has now turned into: No holidays, no alcohol for months, no social life, strain on relationships/friendships.
.
.
So why did I still do it?
The girls ❤ I wanted the community. That community was part of me for so long and I loved it so much. But thankfully I found another little community that aligns very well with my goals and values.

Not words that come out of my mouth very often anymore 🤭
.
.
I used to be obsessed with the idea of abs. I thought I'd be happier in my body. Believed I'd like my body more if I 'liked' how it looked. I didn't understand that abs were never going to make me happy, because my appearance wasn't what I was fighting with, it was a much deeper self loathing 😫 
.
.
What did I do to turn this around (which took years btw):
1. I went to a counsellor and worked on my mental health
2. I started training for performance instead of aesthetics
3. I journalled and practiced gratitude 
4. I stopped talking negatively - not just about myself but others too
.
.
I have never been happier in my own skin - NOTHING to do with how it looks but how I feel 🙌 I feel strong, healthy and empowered. I'm  fit and extremely happy 😁
.
.
Please remember, no clothes size, scale number or body fat percentage will make you happy unless you deal with what's going on in your head. 🙏
.
.
P.s Its so empowering not caring how you look post workout 😅😍

I had a little mini meltdown over the weekend (which btw is more than ok ❤). But it's Monday. The chance of a new beginning and a fresh start ❤
.
.
I also remembered how short term this all seems especially compared to what people experienced at home 🙏 And I looked at the progress all my lovely Irish ladies made during their lockdown period 👊 (Especially Elaine here 😍)
So blinkers are back on 🤟

And this is the little reminder I'm going to give to you - you can use this time to complain, give out and be annoyed. Or you can use this time to make improvements on yourself 🙌
.
.
💫 If you've been looking to start your fitness journey - what better time to start 🙌 (you don't need a gym btw). 

💫 If you're struggling with a routine right now - my regular weekly accountability is a great way to get you started.

💫 If you're eating a lot of crap or drinking too much alcohol - my weekly coaching calls are a great way to educate you on the effects of these things - long term.
.
.
If you have more time and money to invest in yourself - why not choose you ❤🙏 No crazy restrictions, no fads, no excessive training!!!

.
Yes in the physical sense. I have worked for years to get stronger and build a body I feel confident in. I have consistently trained for the last 10 years. First at intercounty football which then led to my love of strength and resistance training😁 My body is a reflection of that.
.
.
But I am so much stronger than my physique. My mental strength is something you cannot see, but it's much stronger than any weight I could lift. Or any competition I'll do. 
I have gone through more than most will go through in a lifetime. I have had my own share of mental health issues. But I have come out the other side. A true reflection of my mental strength.
.
.
I have worked damn hard to be in the position I am in right now. I said to a client last year how lucky I am to have got a job during COVID and how amazing my job, clients and boss are. And she said 'Amanda, you are not lucky. You've worked for this.' She was right. This year as proved that 👊💪

It's an amazing feeling to feel like a strong woman. A strong woman can be intimidating. A strong woman can come off as bossy. A strong woman can get a hostile response especially from the opposite sex. And this is where I acknowledge the strong men in my life. Most notably my Dad was the strongest man I've ever known. Owen has the patience of a saint. And final shout out to the men I've worked with who were not immasculated taking orders from a woman and the bosses I've had who not only considered my opinion but actually valued it. 🙏

Thank you so much Amanda for everything I have learned in the past 12 weeks. The knowledge and confidence I now have will last a lifetime. 

I was diagnosed with PCOS nearly 4 years ago and the Doctor told me that I will just always struggle with my weight. He gave me no information about it. 

Then into a third lockdown, I was feeling unmotivated, lost, and had low self esstem. I turned to Amanda who offered a 12-week program that focused on building habits rather than an all-or-nothing approach. Amanda is so positive, enthusiastic but also really understanding that we are all juggling different things while trying to hit our fitness goals. Since joining Amanda I have lost 5 kg which I am so happy with. But I have also learned a lot about having a more positive outlook on life and on myself. Amanda's habit-building approach really does work without you restricting yourself. I have learned loads about my PCOS which makes me feel more in control. Getting my steps in, drinking 2 liters of water, exercise, 8 hours of sleep, and hitting nutrition goals are part of my day to day now. Amanda has taught me that every day does not have to be perfect, what is important is to try your best and consistency will prevail.",25,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/217216482_355463746022002_7572357503617917088_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=6dehKSKan6wAX9zjlBH&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfBdvi2r7DBU1zaClIdipjVW_W701YlOu8KzzyFQqLr-mA&oe=63D7E4A1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CROCCEUBf94/,17882089532322487,,,,

Last lockdown, I started CrossFit 🥳 I got fit and lost my Sydney stone 😅 This year I'm using it to focus on my business. Why not use this lockdown to better yourself in some way?

💫 Improve your 5km time?
💫 Get better at push ups?
💫 Start an online course?
💫 Read a book? 
💫 Do something creative? 
💫 Invest in yourself 

Learn from the last lockdown.
Allow yourself the weekend for the pity party. But don't let bad habits become your new habits 👊🙌

This is another part of my why 👊
.
.
I've always been a part of a team and a community. I've been so lucky to play football with so many teams over the years and gain so many friends and contacts through sport. 
.
.

CrossFit has nailed the element that a lot of gyms don't have - a community. A lot of commercial gyms have no idea of who comes in their doors, members are just another direct debit. CrossFit took the idea of a community and worked it 🙌 
.
.
But CrossFit is not the only place you can gain a community. I know plenty of other gyms @fullbodyworkhouse @strengthandmovementlab who have built the community aspect into their gyms. And @ownitfit we have a great community vibe 🙌 So if you're not into absolutely Killing yourself (which makes total sense 😅 - crossfit is NOT the only option)
.
.
One of my main goals of my Online coaching was to build a community. Because community has had such a massive impact on my goals and my motivation, I knew it would help others too. And the other day, one of my clients said 'Amanda you really need to emphasis the community element of this programme, because I think that's what sets it aside from other programmes. It's the game changer'. I honestly wanted to cry 😭 I am making all my ideas into real life actions. This is honestly the most excited I have been about my job ever (and for those of you who know me know this is a big statement because I love my job so much 😍)

Here's to building the community online 👊

When people ask me how am I always so motivated. I laugh it off 😅🤦‍♀️ How can you think I'm motivated all the time 🤷‍♀️ I can assure you I'm not. 
.
.
But my goals are more important to me than any excuses 👊 
.
.
Here's some of my goals. Some of which I've never shared with people.

1. Health - health is my number 1 priority. 
👉 Ever since my Dad died at such a young age, I've made it my mission to become healthier. Most people would say I've been healthy since before my Dad died. I would not agree. I may have exercised and ate well but my stress levels were abnormally high and I was WAY too busy. In recent years, I've learned to take a step back and my health has noticed ❤🙏

2. I want to be the fittest person I know (this is one I've never really shared). 
👉 It's a personal goal I've had for quite awhile. What determines fitness to me? Well a multitude of things - Strong, Powerful and having a good engine. I may not be the best individually at any one of them but I'm good at all of them. This is why I think Crossfit suits me because it's being a jack of all trades but master of none 😅🤩

✔ These goals are to live a long, healthy, fulfilling life. I want to succeed in a lot of areas of my life. I always have. I want my just rewards for the effort I put in 🙏 I want to say I am proud of myself and my efforts, always!  This is my why! 

Most people never TRUELY think about their WHY! I have people all the time saying they want to lose weight or tone up but WHY? Ask yourself why? And ask yourself again? Because no weight, no clothes size, no inches lost will ever make you truely happy unless you ask WHY!

With my clients, I always ask why! Sometimes it's difficult for people. Sometimes they've bottled up feelings and emotions they thought they'd never have to open up to.
But honestly, I've changed people's lives by asking this simple question 👊🙌

.
.
Feel like you've tried everything and still see no results? Here's 3 reasons my coaching programme could work for you: 

1. I educate women on nutrition. I don't give meal plans but actually teach you the importance of nutrient dense food. I help you calculate calories and understand the foods you need to fuel your body. I'm also a big advocate of including foods you actually enjoy! 

2. Want to be able to lift your suitcase with ease when lockdown finishes? Want to perform a push up? Want to become a strong, independent female?
I focus on resistance training and encourage women to become the strongest they can be. 

3. I help women become the best versions of themselves. Confidence comes from the inside out and I help women find that sassy female that's hiding inside. 

These are just a few of the amazing elements to my Strong and Sassy programme, not to mention the incredible community that comes with it.

Disclaimer: I actually used to do them 🙈 When I first started out I gave people what they wanted 🤦‍♀️ (not what they needed). But I quickly learned it was not the right approach.
.
.
Meal plans are a band aid 🩹 Let's be honest, we all know what's healthy and what lacks nutrients 🤷‍♀️ We're not all nutritionists but we've a fair grasp that we should be eating more colour and less packaged crap. We should be drinking more water and reducing alcohol intake. 
.
.
Meal plans are essentially a menu of options. This can actually help a very small percentage of people.
.
.
But from my experience, meal plans are NOT enough. Most people need education. Guidance for when things are not going perfectly and support for getting started. People need to introduce small incremental changes that lead to new habits. And people have lives they want to live. Meal plans don't account for this. They are strict rigid plans that focus solely on main meals and don't allow for life's pleasures 🍫🍷

Amanda, I’m so sorry this took so long but I didn’t know how to express my gratitude. I still don’t think I will do you justice but I just wanted to say thank you so much for your help and support over the last 8 months. I started this message so many times over the past few weeks and I always ended up getting emotional 🙈 I cannot thank you enough for everything! So much has changed since our initial phone call! When I started I was stuck in a rut, lacked motivation and had got in bad habits, I was not in a great mindset! I don’t even know how to explain how much things have changed, but you already know that! I feel like a new woman with a new perspective of all things health! When I signed up I was looking for help getting back exercising and to create a new routine, I had no specific goals but just to feel good again and by god I feel like a new woman! But it’s not just the physical transformation, what I lost in inches I gained multiple times over in knowledge, confidence and mental strength! I know you will say that I did all the work but I couldn’t have done it without your support and encouragement, not to mention all the girls in the group call 🥰 I feel absolutely fantastic Amanda! I know I’ll be back for a refresher course at some stage so until then thank you 😊",33,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/208962429_533356394743993_4518219819058147180_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=6HnJ9N2kE9AAX9-nvrt&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfBh9OQ_KqXZNNc-xV6Cn9TcbhaPOafxc52hR1ynFbQ5Ng&oe=63D86BC4,https://www.instagram.com/p/CQqC5WABsiC/,17866065761527288,,,,

One of the main reasons I started online coaching was to get the opportunity to work with more people. I love the idea that no where is off limits and I can extend my coaching guidance to anywhere in the world.
.
.
In the last year, I am so proud of the community I have built within my coaching business ❤🙏 The ladies I work with on a daily basis literally make my job feel like it's not a job. They are the most incredible women with all very different goals but very similar personalities and values 🙏
Unfortunately, they are not all based in one place so its hard to organise getting them all to catch up. But today,  a group of them met up 💕

.
And it's the perfect opportunity to welcome the newest member to the Coach Mc Loone team. I am so excited to have @lisacuddyfitness on my team.

I see this one a lot.

You are individual. You are not like anyone else, so why would you compare yourself to anyone else? 🤷‍♀️
.
.
Most of the time the circumstances aren't  even comparable. Let's give you some examples
❎ Comparing your image to celebrities 
❎ Comparing your performance to athletes
❎ Comparing your body to fitness influencers
.
.
If you are not where you want to be, being honest it is probably something you are or are not doing. BUT you are making life a hell of a lot more difficult for yourself by setting unrealistic goals and targets 🎯
.
.
✔ Start by setting some realistic goals
✔ Progression over perfection 
✔ Be consistent - stop giving it a short term tag. Look at the long term. Look at your future self.
✔ Find something you enjoy - you are more likely to stick to it
.
.
Stop blaming other people and start looking at what you need to do to get where you want to be 👊 
.
.
And remember no number on the scales will make you happy unless you deal with the shit in your head 🧠

Amanda, I just wanted to say thank you so much for everything you've done for me over the last 6 months. I was looking back over everything and chatting to my family over the last couple of days and one of the biggest wins I have throughout all of this is the mentality change I've had. I'm happier, more confident in myself and generally fitter. I look back to my first few coaching calls and I was so nervous, it's incredible how comfortable I've become on them now😅 I'm gonna miss them and chatting to yourself and the group so much, honestly. At the start one of my biggest goals was to get myself looking better aswell as getting stronger, but now it's a different ball game. As I said above, the change in mindset I've had, has made me realise bit everything is about being tiny and lean, I'm still adjusting to going back to normal life and keeping healthy, and it'll get there! I'm not at all focused on the aesthetic side of things anymore. The tips, tricks and habits you've given me over the last couple of months will stay with me for life! I'm so extremely grateful for you for taking me on, you've no idea at all. ❤️

Firstly, do you track your period? Do you even know when your period is due? If not, why not?
Cycles are a very important part of a woman's life and a lot of elements can be affected at different phases of our cycle and not just our hormones 🙀 💥Have you ever noticed you're more productive at certain times? 
💥 Noticed you're stronger at certain times?
💥 Is your sleep affected at certain times? 
What gets measured gets managed 👊👊👊
.
.
OK, so you've started tracking...
And you notice, ok my cycle length is a lot longer than normal (21-35 days). You know you're not pregnant (immaculate conception 😇). So what could it be?

There are many factors that may contribute to your irregular cycle.

.
.
I pride myself on it actually. I've alway been a pro choice kinda girl in all aspects of life (not just health and fitness related). You'll never hear me boast about one type of diet or slate any either. You won't hear me downgrade any form of exercise, although I do openly talk about the huge benefits of resistance training 💪 I'll never tell any of my client's 'You have to do this type of exercise' or 'you cannot eat this for weight loss'. So you see I'm very open minded. If someone who loves yoga comes to me, I'm not going to force them to lift weights. And if someone who is vegan comes to me, I would not force them to eat animal products. My problem with any of these things lies in the misinformation. .
.
.
Did you know that vegan fast food production has sky rocketed in recent years? 🤔 Similarly, a few years ago, gluten free products were a huge trend? And before that, sugar free was the hype? This I have a problem with.
.
.
Veganism is a lifestyle choice. I have huge respect for anyone's lifestyle choices, whether they conform to my own is irrelevant. What actually annoys me is actual vegans are getting a terrible name due to all these people jumping on the bandwagon, thinking veganism is the healthiest lifestyle going. People are going into this lifestyle, uneducated and naive. 😒 It was the same a few years ago when gluten free was the buzzword. Did you know you can have a totally adequate, balanced, healthy diet without adding one gluten free product? And thats for ACTUAL coeliacs out there, because they are the ONLY people that need to be eating gluten free toast 😂
.
.
What my very long winded post is trying to say is stop jumping on bandwagons. If you are and always have been vegan, that's fine. Continue with your choices. If you are coeliac, continue with your gluten free bread 🙈 
.
For the rest of you, stop following trends by the latest celebrity diet.
❎ Stop conforming to social norms ✊ 
❎Stop basing your beliefs on a bloody stupid documentary 😒 
✅Get some advice from a professional. 🙏
✅ Follow said advice 🌈 
✅ And unfollow anyone giving terrible, uneducated advice

13,2021-06-11T06:05:20+0000,"Let's clear something up... 
.
.
There is no perfect form of coaching ❎
Or perfect form of exercise ❎
.
.
Each style has it's pros and cons 😈
.
.
But it is the form that you can consistently work with and that give you long term sustainable results - that works for you. That does not mean it works for everyone 🤔
.
.
Let me give you some scenarios.
.
.
One of my online clients first approached me for in person PT. She didn't know I lived in Austrailia 🙈🤣 She wasn't interested in online coaching due to wasting money on previous online programmes. This lady works 2 jobs and barely has time for herself let alone fitting into a PT schedule. Online coaching was a great option for her. She lost 18lbs and felt amazing in her wedding dress 🥳
.
.
I have a friend who tried online coaching...twice. First time went well, second time not as well. Nothing wrong with the programme, she just responds better to in person accountability. She is now doing in person PT and loving it 🥳
.
.
There's nothing special about Crossfit. It's more the community and the vibe than the exercise prescription people enjoy. 
.
.
Running may be an excellent form of exercise for an introvert but an extrovert might find it very isolating...
.
.
My point?
1. Just because Sharon got results from a PT does not mean that PT has extraordinary powers. This form of coaching got Sharon results because it was something she CONSISTENTLY did and could stick to.
2. There is no right or wrong coaching style - just what works for you. 
3. Please find something you enjoy and can see yourself doing for the next 50 years 🙏 As opposed to hating exercise, see it as a blessing 👏

I think the impression I portray on social media is of a strong, independent female who has her shit together. Most of the time, this is me. But I haven't always been this way. 

I had issues...
Serious ones...
Ones I struggled with for years...
Ones I didn't even realise I had until I look back... 

💥I was an attention seeker.
I wore skimpy clothes. I was the loudest, most outspoken person in every group. Most people would mistake me for confident.
But I was craving people's attention. I wanted people to like me, wanted people to care because I didn't always get that recognition growing up. 

💥I was a perfectionist.
The control of being the best in every situation. I'm not going to lie this is still one I struggle with to a degree but compared to where I was, they are miles apart 🙏 

💥I drank to forget.
A lot of my late teens, early 20s I would pass out before I could even make it to a club. We all laughed at the time, I was known for 'Never making it out' but honestly this was yet another cry for help. 

Look I'm not going to say I had the worst upbringing in the world because that is just not true. But that doesn't mean that parts of your childhood/life don't form who you become years later. I never had problems with weight or issues with weight loss but that doesn't mean I haven't faced my own demons. 

I deal with women on a daily basis who have terrible relationships with food because of 
1. Their home life (control often leading to eating disorders or disordered eating)
2. Family figures - Parents who excessively dieted or commented on appearance regularly
3. Fad diets - I actually had a woman just this morning who I'm trying to convince there is no such thing as a 'bad' food but her years of WW has told her to stay away from fats 🤦‍♀️ 

I'm not a psychologist. I don't try to be. I am a  nutritionist so I don't veer outside the scope of my practice but I do want to help. I want to help women heal their relationship with food. I want to help them realise their worth is not based on a number or a figure. I want them to see food as fuel and not be afraid of it.

.
.
1. Fill up your plate with nutrient dense, low calorie vegetables.
2. Add a decent protein source - opt for oily fish regularly 3-4 times a week. White meat/fish is lower calorie if weight loss is the goal. 
3. You don't need to eliminate carbohydrates. Our body wants them. Our brain needs them. Just reduce your portion size and choose the right type of carbs.
4. Fats are also vitally important for hormone health, vitamin absorption  and a fuel source.

Then one day I decided to take it serious. I booked in for a consult with @advancedrejuvenationbondi I started getting regular facials. I started listening to my body - training with it rather than against it. I reduced my stress levels. I reduced dairy from my diet. This was a process. It didn't all happen in one day. I took it step by step day by day. I was patient 🙈 (for once in my life). And now 9 months on, I'm reaping the rewards 🙏😍

.
.
Quite often I hear people recommending high protein diets without having a clue why they are recommending it 🤷‍♀️
.
.
My clients know why I recommend up to 2g Protein/KG BW/day 🙌 Why? Because I educate them why 👊
.
.
1. TEF - Our total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) is made up for 4 components - BMR, NEAT, Purposeful Activity and TEF. It accounts for up to 10% of our TDEE. Protein rich foods have a higher thermic effect from food than any other macro nutrient.
.
2. Satiety - Protein is super filling. It's difficult to eat large quantities without feeling full. This is a good complaint 😜
.
3. Recovery - Protein is required for so many processes in our body. Regardless of your goals - weight loss, weight gain, performance - everyone will benefit from a high protein diet.

Now that I've got your attention...
Let me ask a more serious question..
.
.
Who likes shopping? ☝
.
.
I'm not gonna lie, I'm still no shopaholic but shopping these days is a lot more enjoyable.
.
.
Why? 🤔
.
.
Because I base clothes on how I look in them- not what size they are 🤷‍♀️
.
.
Honestly, let me ask a serious question. Ask yourself -

🎯 How many times have you NOT ate before shopping to make sure you look 'skinny' when trying on clothes?

🎯 How many times have you been upset because the size you wanted to be didn't fit you?

🎯 How many times have you dieted to fit into a certain item of clothing? 
.
.
Why? 
.
.
It destroys my soul to see women so unhappy in their bodies and believe me I've been there 😭 Your worth is not based on a number. Your value is not in a clothes size. Why are we so obsessed with such unimportant values? 🤦‍♀️

Let me give you a very quick briefing on my sporting career.
.
.
I started off on the sideline. I stayed on the sideline until... one day coaches couldn't but see the hard work I was putting in. And then I got on the pitch. And I stayed on the pitch. For 14 Years with St. Faithleachs, 10 years with Roscommon and 2 years with Garrycastle. Throw in a few school teams, college teams and a provisional squad 🙌
.
.
What will I be remembered for as a footballer?
- My work ethic and engine. I didn't grow up the most skilful. My co ordination is actually terrible. So I controlled the controllables 👊
.
.
2 weeks ago I was asked to compete on a CrossFit team and all I could think back to was when I was in school being the last person picked for every sport. I wasn't happy as that person. I changed that person 🙏 You have the power too 👊

.
.
Feel like you've tried everything and still see no results? Here's 3 reasons my coaching programme could work for you: 

1. I educate women on nutrition. I don't give meal plans but actually teach you the importance of nutrient dense food. I help you calculate calories and understand the foods you need to fuel your body. I'm also a big advocate of including foods you actually enjoy! 

2. Want to be able to lift your suitcase with ease when lockdown finishes? Want to perform a push up? Want to become a strong, independent female?
I focus on resistance training and encourage women to become the strongest they can be. 

3. I help women become the best versions of themselves. Confidence comes from the inside out and I help women find that sassy female that's hiding inside. 

These are just a few of the amazing elements to my Strong and Sassy programme, not to mention the incredible community that comes with it.

Can you believe that I RARELY tell clients they 'Can't' have something.
.
.
I think people expect a nutritionist to give you a short list of foods you can eat to achieve your goals 🤦‍♀️ This could NOT be further from the truth.
.
.
Majority of the time I'm adding foods to their diet: Water, Colour, Protein, Wine (lol I don't add this but I don't exclude it either).
.
.
You see most of the time - unless your  goals are REALLY specific, you can actually include a little of the foods and drinks you like. If you look at health as a long term thing and not just a 6 week challenge, you can actually have your cake and eat it too 🍰
.
.
All I will say is don't lose sight of the goal. I may be having a glass of wine in this photo but I also have water in front of me too. I may eat chocolate but I eat a lot of colour too. I choose not to drink on Fridays so I can train Saturday mornings.

.
.
Here's is my nutrition triangle. This is not a standard pyramid, it's mostly just my opinion 😁
.
.
Diet is defined as the kinds of food a person habitually eats. No diet will ever be successful if someone cannot successfully stick to it and be consistent with it. And for this reason, it is my bread and butter. It is the most important element when it comes to nutrition.
.
.
I am a nutritionist so Food Quality is my next most important element. I know in terms of energy balance it is as simple as calories in versus calories out but I just cannot educate people and say that
Food quality doesn't matter. If I didn't care about my clients and I just cared about transformation photos I could give someone a calorie calculator and say 'Here once it's within your calories it doesn't matter what the meals include'. Maybe not for body composition (questionable) but certainly for long term health 🤦‍♀️
.
.
Then, I put calories. Calories do matter but to me food quality matters more. As I've said, this is opinion. At the end of the day, it is an energy balance equation so I can't disregard them but just be aware of how inaccurate logging and tracking can be. Just be informed 👊
.
.
Technically that should be macronutrients but I'm putting protein as the king 🤴 Although I do feel very strongly about good balance so please don't disregard carbs and fats 😬
.
.
Lastly, comes supplements. Supplements should always be an addition.

I know feel empowered and feel confident with what I’m doing and the biggest take away being that progress isn’t linear and you have to be a support to yourself! Balance is key and working out should done for mental and physical well being rather than wanting to have disco muscles! I was really struggling in the food dept and knowing what targets I should aim for!

The fitness industry is becoming saturated. There is so much conflicting information it's overwhelming to even know where to start. I want to stand out and not fade into the same mould.
.
.
I'm pretty safe though because:

❎ I won't be that 'hot' fitness model - although leave some 🔥 if you love the posts of my sweaty red head
❎ I won't be posing in lingerie to get thousands followers - although I do look good in Lingerie 😜
❎ I won't be putting videos up of myself doing 10 variations of crunches or booty band workouts.
.
.
I actually struggle to find time to put up content these days because I am so busy with my clients. All my time, effort and education goes into helping everyone of them. They have invested their time and money in me and I'm so proud of the work we do together ❤
.
.
Anyway, I'm going to be different to a lot of other fitness accounts - I'm not going to say its just as simple as 'Eat Less, Move More✌'. 
Sorry unfortunately I just don't think it is.
.
.
My hierarchy begins with stress reduction - why?
.
.
Well because stress in all shapes and sizes leads to incredible problems in the body. 
Example: Stress of too little calories - Can lead to hormonal disruptions which can lead to amenorrhoea which can lead to infertility. Too little calories and poor food quality can lead to micronutrient deficiencies and injury. 
Stress can be as simple as drinking too much caffeine or as severe as overwhelm. Add up all the daily stresses in your life and see how many there are😱
.
.
Sleep should be AS IMPORTANT as exercise and nutrition combined - end of story😴
.
.
Nutrition and food quality come next.🥦
.
.
Exercise in general should technically come next but this is my pyramid so I'm going to do what I believe is most important - irrespective of goals! 🏋‍♀️
.
.
Lastly, individual variance. Have a condition or a goal? Follow all the below first and foremost and the individuality should come last

✅ Training average twice a week for 52 weeks is better than 7 days a week for 4 weeks (every time you 'restart' your fitness journey)
✅ Drinking 1.5L water daily is better than yoyo extremes of 3L and 500ml
✅ Eating Whole Nutritious food 50% of the time 52 weeks a year is better than your 'starting Monday' almost every week

Remember, you and your body is a representation of what you do most of the time, not some of the time.

.
.
Which is best?
.
.
Answer is.
.
.
Neither are better, neither are worse.
.
.
I eat both. But why you are eating it depends on your goals 👊👊👊
.
.
✅ Weight loss a goal? Cauliflower rice is low in calories and high in volume so may be a great option
✅Alternatively, portion control of brown rice can also work.
✅ Performance a goal? You will not get the same complex carbs from caulifower rice as you will from brown rice. 
✅ Both have different nutritional compositions when it comes to vitamins and minerals.
✅ Taste? Force feeding yourself cauliflower rice because your favourite fitness influencer recommended it? YOU ARE JUST BEING STUPID!!!! 
.
.
There is no right or wrong answer to comparing these. As always, it is dependent on your individual goals and anyone that gives you a clear defined answer is a fruad 😅🚫

Some tips to change this mindset:
1. Stop focusing on the number on the scales - start focusing on the weight you are lifting
2. Stop seeing food as calories - start seeing food as fuel and nutrients
3. Stop trying to look like someone else - start trying to look like the best version of you

.
.
✅ Protein is essential for recovery especially from exercise, illness or injury
✅ Protein saties you. It gives you a 'fuller' feeling. No matter what your goals, feeling more satisfied is a good thing right?
✅ The Thermic Effect of Protein is high. So it actually contributes to our overall TDEE. Food type and nutrient composition is important 😁 A calorie is just a calorie but the sources those calories come from matters.
.
.
I recommend 2g/kg BW/day. People find this hard to hit especially without supplements. So here is an idea of what 150g of protein looks like in a day 😊
(P.s I would not recommend tuna everyday due to heavy metals.)

.

.

So one of the things I harp on about constantly as a nutritionist is trying to get more vegetables in my client's diet 🥦🥒🍄

.

.

But did you know how you cook your veggies can have an impact on it's nutritional status? For example: when boiling vegetables you may lose a lot of the vitamins in the water. Roasting vegetables can actually change the glycaemic index of a food. And any cooking method  can cause loss of fibre from the vegetables.

. 

.

What does this mean?

Get a variety of vegetables in your diet. And a variety of different cooking methods 

E.g A salad for lunch and roast veggies for dinner

Or Raw Spinach for breakfast and a stirfy for lunch

Feel like you've tried everything and still see no results? Here's 3 reasons my coaching programme could work for you: 

1. I educate women on nutrition. I don't give meal plans but actually teach you the importance of nutrient dense food. I help you calculate calories and understand the foods you need to fuel your body. I'm also a big advocate of including foods you actually enjoy! 

2. Want to be able to lift your suitcase with ease when lockdown finishes? Want to perform a push up? Want to become a strong, independent female?
I focus on resistance training and encourage women to become the strongest they can be. 

3. I help women become the best versions of themselves. Confidence comes from the inside out and I help women find that sassy female that's hiding inside.

This is something I encourage highly with all my clients. We are all busy being employees, mothers, wives, grandmothers, friends, bosses etc. We all do so much for everyone else, sometimes we forget about ourselves 😢

Ever heard the saying you can't pour from an empty cup? Actually that saying makes no sense surely it should be pot? 🤔 Anyway same theory applies....
.
.
Some of my selfcare advice:
✅ Find something you enjoy and do it EVERY single day. It might be 5 or 50 minutes but make the time for it
✅ Stop putting everyone else's needs ahead of your own
.
.
Some options if you can't think:
✅ Meditate - I use an App called Bloom and I have a discount code of BLOOMERS 🙌
✅ Jigsaws/Wordsearches/Crossword Puzzles
✅ Exercise - I've always used this one. But lately I've found I need something to help me unwind after CrossFit. I've started Yoga.
✅ Read a book
✅ Listen to a podcast/music
✅ Have a chat with a friend
✅ Have a cup of tea in peace
✅ Sit Outdoors
.
.
These are just some of my favourites. But do something for you EVERY.SINGLE.DAY ❤

🎯There are micro nutrient differences like white potatoes contain more potassium. Sweet potatoes have a lot more vitamin A. 
🎯Their Glycaemic Index is also quite different - white potatoes are High GI while sweet potato is lower GI.
🎯But macro nutrient wise there's very little difference 👊

This weekend was honestly one of the toughest weekends physically and mentally. Not just because the quarter finals were a million miles outside my comfort zone but I've also had super long days studying 🤦‍♀️ 
.
.
My body was under recovered, my mind was zapped. I was not prepared for these tests. My friends got me through each and everyone ❤ With a special shout out to @lauraoreilly__
Who was with me for all 5. I'm only a year into this journey so I'm so excited to see what the future brings 🙌

7,2021-04-10T10:58:12+0000,"Some of my favourite things about Austrailia:

✅Early Mornings - I've always been an early riser (like my Dad). But in Ireland it's not normal, I love that I'm the majority here when my alarm goes off for 5am 

✅ Breakfast - Any day but especially the weekends. Saturday mornings are made for the CrossFit followed by Breakfast. Honestly, it's one of my absolute favourite things to do down by the beach 🥰 

✅ Health and Fitness are a priority- do we have a recurring theme here 🤣 If I stay in my Grannys house in Donegal, there isn't a gym within a 30 mile radius 🙈 Over here almost every second building is a gym 

✅ Weekends are for Fun - whether you want to include alcohol or not, every weekend there is something new to do and in the 60 weeks I've been here I've done something new almost every weekend. Apart from CrossFit and Breakfast - that's a constant. 

✅ Tan - I haven't wore fake tan since September 🥰 Dont worry I wear SPF everyday 

✅ Friends are like Family - I saved the best for last. Friendships are intensified by the fact that we're so far away from home together. I love this though, I've made friends for life in such a short period of time ❤🙏

.
.
Feel like you've tried everything and still see no results? Here's 3 reasons my coaching programme could work for you: 

1. I educate women on nutrition. I don't give meal plans but actually teach you the importance of nutrient dense food. I help you calculate calories and understand the foods you need to fuel your body. I'm also a big advocate of including foods you actually enjoy! 

2. Want to be able to lift your suitcase with ease when lockdown finishes? Want to perform a push up? Want to become a strong, independent female?
I focus on resistance training and encourage women to become the strongest they can be. 

3. I help women become the best versions of themselves. Confidence comes from the inside out and I help women find that sassy female that's hiding inside. 

These are just a few of the amazing elements to my Strong and Sassy programme, not to mention the incredible community that comes with it.

Never use it's too late as an excuse. The time passes anyway.

It is never too late to make an improvement to your health. 

Stop waiting. There will never be a good time. Just do it!

We all do it. 
.
.
I asked on my story the other day do you only wait UNTIL you are injured to go to the physio. Only 1 person said they go regularly 🙈
.
.
Ok, I understand maybe you're not going to go until maybe there is a little ache or pain or tweak etc. But please stop waiting until that festers into an actual problem. I'd say physios most common thing to hear is 'Oh ya I've had that for years'. It's not 'normal' to be in pain constantly 🤦‍♀️ 
.
.
Same goes for a coach. I feel people think you need to be overweight to invest in a coach. This couldn't be further from the truth ❎❎ 
.
.
Some of the reasons I suggest to invest in a coach:
1. You are not happy in your body - inside and/or outside
2. You don't know what to do to achieve your goals
3. You have tried every diet in the book and failed
4. You lack motivation
.
.
Don't keep holding it off. You don't need to be broken to be fixed ❎

This was never even in my thoughts or goals but I'll take it. After just one year doing CrossFit competively, I'm beyond excited to see where the next few years takes me 🙌
.
.
I can honestly say there were no low lights to my second Open experience. 
.
.
🎯21.1 - I was happy with an exercise no one was prepared for and my double unders have come on 10 fold since my last Open
🎯21.2 - My Fav 🥰 (a past footballers dream)
🎯21.3 - 11 (fugly) Muscle Ups - I WILL TAKE THAT
🎯21.4 - Hang Cleans are my limiting factor 
.
.
I am Terrfied for what the next stage brings but just getting to this stage is the win for me. Special thanks to @crossfitcoogee and the team. I would not be where I am without your help 👊
.

Proud of myself is an understatement ❤🙌

There I said it. I can admit when I'm wrong.
.
.
🎯I thought people would want to eat like me - and I got frustrated when people wouldn't. I would remove foods from their diets and limit their treats. I couldn't understand when people couldn't sustain it?
'What did you think Susan this was going to be easy?'

✅ I thought people would prioritise sleep like me - I neglected the fact I was working with mothers and shift workers. I painted everyone with the one brush.

👊I thought everyone's goals were the same as me. I thought everyone was willing to make huge sacrifices. 

🙈 Honestly, I just considered people moany or whingy when they couldn't do what I asked them.
.
.
I do these things. Why can't they?
.
.
Because Amanda - their goals are completely different to yours 🤦‍♀️.
.
.
Years of experience made me realise what a fool I was. People want something sustainable and what people are willing to commit and sacrifice are totally different for everyone 🤦‍♀️
.
.
What I've realised:
💫 People need to change habits slowly
💫 Quick fixes don't work
💫 People need to enjoy the exercise they're doing - not necessarily the exercise you want them to do - 80% of what they like, 20% of what they need
💫 People need accountability 
💫 People need to be able to talk to their coach/trainer/nutritionist 
💫 People who really care will invest in themselves
💫 The journey is so much easier with a community spirit
.
.
So yet again. I was wrong. I made mistakes and now I'm making up for them. 🙋‍♀️
.
.

I've played sport my whole life but I've never been part of a community that care more about one another. The beauty (and the downfall) of most sports is competition. CrossFit is competition to improve yourself, never at the expense of someone else. Watching these girls take on RX workouts is honestly as thrilling as doing it myself. I am so proud of every single person in this picture ❤

🎯 A physically and mentally stronger person
🎯 A girl who is finally happy in her own skin
🎯 A girl who doesn't care what the scales says
🎯 Someone who has learned a lot.
🎯 Someone who has made mistakes 
🎯 A fighter
🎯 No dress size dictates her happiness
🎯 Has a good relationship with food
🎯 Eats to fuel herself and her performance
🎯 Has found balance

I can promise you all - no number on the scales, no clothes size, no diet plan will make you happy unless you deal with your 'why'. 👊

I had all the knowledge in the world re nutrition. I trained. And none of it mattered until I realised why I was so unhappy in my body. (I was looking through old photos and I literally used to take photos every SINGLE day to see if my body changed 😭). Once I understood my why - everything changed.

I hope each and everyone of you leave some time for you every day. I don't mean hours, it can be minutes. But every day you need to find some 'you time'. 
.
.
Everyone has something different. Meditate, read a book, listen to a podcast, drink a cup of tea - just find what works for you. And do it daily. 
.
.
Now, find something you need to do for yourself every so often. For me up until recently It was go on 2 big holidays a year and a couple of weekend breaks. I understand that is not something everyone can do at the moment but why not make a plan for when it is? Or save or invest in something for you - it may be a new car, a new couch, some home gym equipment? 
.
.
In recent years I've realised the importance of self care. I invest in holidays and my health.

.
🎯It never ceases to amaze me how people can spend $100's on handbags but a physio appointment is too expensive? 🤦‍♀️
🎯 I still can't comprehend how a facial or a massage is seen as a luxury but 3 uber eats a week is normal?
🎯 Coaching is a waste of money but alcohol and drugs are 'worth it' 

I know it all comes down to priorities, I understand that. Not everyone sees the benefit of investing in your physical and mental health right now. I get that. But don't think these things are 'expensive' or a 'luxury' if you are literally throwing away your money 🙈❎

There is nothing too mind blowing here. There's a very recurring theme. .
.
.
✅Eat a good balanced of carbohydrates, fats and proteins.
The luteal phase is a time that cravings are high so try to stabilise blood sugars.
✅Increase calories during certain phases if needs be. And possible reduction during other phases. It's your body's requirements!
✅Eat anti inflammatory foods - wholefoods with colour. 
✅Sufficient magnesium in your diet - seeds, dark chocolate, nuts 
✅Green Leafy, Cruciferous Vegetables - This will help the liver reduce any excess estrogen.
✅ Reduce alcohol, caffeine and salt to avoid fluid retention
.
.
Nutrition around your cycle is important. But if you're like me and have a great diet, full of colour, high in all macronutrients and don't drink alcohol to often then you're doing pretty darn well 🙌 Anything extra is a bonus 🙌

I had the fantastic @balancecounsellingathlone on to give a talk about Self Esteem and Self Love to my clients 🙏 And honestly, everything she spoke about reaffirmed my thoughts on how far I've come at becoming my own best friend ❤
.
.
A few years ago, I would not be able to give the advice I now give to clients. Why?
Well because I didn't believe in myself. 
.
.
Some examples of healthy self esteem:
🎯 Being able to say no
🎯 Having positive thoughts
🎯 Self confidence 
🎯 Accepting your flaws
.
.
I have turned my low self esteem issues like 'not feeling good enough', 'feeling like a doormat' and 'being jealous of others' into a positive/healthy light 🙏
.
.
I was also so proud of my clients sharing their feelings with Olive. This truely shows how much more open and honest they are becoming in themselves 🙏
.
.
What I bring to my coaching is MUCH MUCH more than just exercise and nutrition. If you are interested, why not join my FREE 5 Day Programme. Link is in my bio 🥳🥳🥳

P.s A make up and filter free picture(well that's not something you see very often😅) because ya know what I feel bloody great. Inside and out 😘

After I did my ACL, I started to do box squats. I felt comfortable with box squats. I didn't feel pain and I had a bigger ego (I.e I could lift heavier). Thankfully, box squats were transferable to my sport so I didn't even think about full depth squats. I was hitting 1RM 135kg comfortably. I was pretty happy 👌 Until I had to go back to below parallel squats (CrossFit). Where was my strength? I was struggling with 40kg. I was hiding behind this half depth strength and when it came to a full squat my body hadn't a clue what was happening 🙈

My period was 14 days late. 
.
.
It wasn't a fear of pregnancy. Quite the opposite actually. Don't forget our menstrual cycle is a sign of health 🙏 
.
.
10 years ago if you had said to me, give me a once off tablet to never have my period again, I would have taken it. Why? Because I considered it 'disgusting' or 'an inconvenience'. I was so uneducated. But being totally honest I just didn't care about my health enough either 😬
.
.
I have been so in tune with my body the last 5 months that it honestly came as a huge shock to me to have such an irregular cycle 😢 I harp on to all my clients about it's importance and here I was with a 42 day cycle. 
.
.
The thing about the menstrual cycle is, it's sensitive. It can't deal with too much stress. But remember stress looks different on everyone 🤷‍♀️ For me last month I travelled time zones (this ALWAYS puts my cycle off) and I had my 30th Birthday weekend (the most alcohol I've drank in months - another stress). 
.
.
One long cycle like that due to stress is ok. But if it's a continuing problem, it is really worth seeking medical advice or help from a professional.
.
.
You may not be thinking about it now. But amenorrhoea or irregular menstrual cycles can have a profound effect on your future health.
.
.
My advice:
✅Start tracking 
✅ Understand the different phases in your cycle
✅ Monitor symptoms, emotions, feelings, productivity, energy.
.
.
Work with your body, not against 🙏❤",318,7,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/159884040_117438617030111_7106702845683173585_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=OS4ZYMix5ogAX8FdVKr&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfCG1Dj6eTyN3fQ6XgMyHN--NzLtrt7g0YRca13rVYj9sQ&oe=63D8F6E9,https://www.instagram.com/p/CMZDxpbBwf-/,17891045272982802,,"[{'timestamp': '2021-03-14T12:07:21+0000', 'text': 'You both ❤️🙌...whats the weather like?

.
.
I will never tire of people calling me fit. I loved when people didn't want to mark me. I am so proud anytime someone calls me a 'tank' or a 'machine' 😅 

.
Why?
Because of where I started and where I came from ❤
.
.
I was not always fit. I was definitely not skilful. But my God find someone who was a harder worker than me.
.
.
Hard Work 
✅I went from the girl who had to give her football boots to another player to making the county team.
✅I went from the scrawny midfielder to the strong full back. 
✅I made the bloody Connacht panel. And rest assured I was not the most talented defender in the province.
✅ Weddings, 21st Birthdays, social occassions, holidays, j1s - all missed
.
.
Consistency
✅ I was back on the pitch with Roscommon 8 months after my ACL reconstruction
✅ I was in the gym 2 days after surgery on my wrist
✅ 8 weeks after dislocating my knee I took part in a Crossfit Competition and achieved my top 10 goal.
.
.
Determination
✅ After being told I'd never be the same footballer after my ACL injury - I came back stronger and fitter than ever. Ill never forget winning my first sprint the day I went back to full training or scoring the winning point the day of my return to play
✅ I won a CrossFit competition on a Saturday, played in a county semi final on a Wednesday - did great in both
✅ At 28 with Achilles Tendonopathy, I played 2 games - 1 county, 1 club - I actually HIGHLY do not recommend this 😬🤦‍♀️
.
.
This is not intended to be a boast post 😅 Although I'm pretty bloody proud of all of the above - apart from the 2 games in 1 day, that was pure stupidity ❎ 
.
.
This is almost 20 years of time and effort. 20 years of commitment. 20 years of sacrifice. (I've sacrificed a lot less in recent times, priorities shifted).
So before you think about quitting because you haven't seen results in 6 weeks. Think about the commitment you're giving. Think about the sacrifice you're making. 
.
.
Think about where you can be in 20 years time 👊

Yesterday in Austrailia we celebrated Mardi Gras. I am, have been and always will be a 'love is love' advocate ❤🙏
.
.
I do however, see a little problem within our society 😢 We focus so much on finding love with another person that we forget to love ourselves 😔
.
.
A few years ago I would have found this talk 'absolutely ridiculous' 🤦‍♀️ The same person would self sabotage with alcohol 🤷‍♀️ It's a very individual belief and idea. It doesn't look the same on everyone so here's my two cents.
.
.
What self love means to me:
❎ Not seeking other people's approval - doing things for myself, not others
❎ Not being jealous - it's a terrible trait to compare yourself, your possessions or your life to others. Find happiness within what you have or within what you do - if you're not happy, change it. This was a MAJOR turning point for me
✔ Be content with the person you are - your traits, your characteristics - what makes you you ❤ And again, if there is something you are not happy with - remember you have the power to change it.
✔ Be happy in your own company - another game changer. I am beyond blessed with Owen, the very large group of friends I have, the work I do and the training I do. I am a social butterfly and I love that. But I am very comfortable being in my own company and alone also.
.
.
I was so lucky to have found Owen at a period in my life where I really didn't love myself and I needed his attention so much. That puts pressure on a relationship. Insecurity is difficult. But in the time we've been together he's seen a change to me, a welcome change. (He actually said to me just last night how proud he is of me 🥰😭)
.
.
I am so happy within myself. I'm confident in my work. I love my body - not for how it looks but for what it can do. I love my soul - I am a good person and the friends I have are proof of that. 
.
.
It's MORE than ok to give yourself a pat on the back. Its more than ok to say how proud you are of yourself.
.
.

Stress is not just 'feeling stressed'. I always ask my clients about stress levels. Most people respond with either 'yes I'm stressed or no I'm not stressed'. Stress is a lot more complex than 'feeling stressed'.
.
.
Stress can present itself from so many things,some which I'm sure you're aware of, some which you won't realise 🙈 (the above is just a handful)
.
.
When you're stressed body switches on fight or flight mode - releases Adrenaline, Nora adrenaline, Cortisol.
.
🎯Adrenaline increases heart rate, breath faster and tenses muscles.
🎯Noradrenaline diverts blood from (unessential areas during fight or flight) reproductive system, digestive and skin.
🎯Cortisol raises blood pressure and blood sugar levels.
.
We need stress hormones in our body, but the problem arises when they are imbalanced.

🎯 Hormonal imbalances can have an affect on bone density
🎯 Too much exercise causes stress on the body
🎯 Nutrient deficiencies can have detrimental consequences on people's health
🎯 The knock on affect of dieting or exercise obsession can have an impact on social occassions
🎯 Obsession with food can lead to disordered eating
.
.
The above literally scratch the surface of the negatives of too much exercise or dieting.
.
.
I need women to realise you are NOT just looking at the here and now. What you do now impacts you in the years to come. As a mother maybe? Or a grandmother? Please please please think of that next time you decide to embark on your fitness journey 🙈

I'm into fast, convenient nutritious meals and this hits the spot 🙌
.
.
Ingredients:
⭐ Honey and Soy Skewers - (but you can just marinade yourself overnight)
⭐ Quinoa packet - can also buy ready made if you want to make this even faster
⭐ Spinach & Carrot - use whatever salad or veggies you like
⭐ Balsamic Dressing
.
.
I used the air fryer for the chicken but alternatively you could bake in oven - 20 mins. While thats cooking - make up Quinoa - 7 mins (instructions on pack). Add veggies and balsamic dressing. Ready to eat in 20 mins 🌟

Quite often people think you need to do more to achieve your goals. And in a lot of cases that is true - more exercise, more water, better nutrition. But for some actually less is more. 
.
.
Everyone has their problem areas. Some people nail nutrition and exercise and can't understand why they can't lose weight - while their bodies are in chronic sleep deprivation 🤦‍♀️ Others weigh in the week before their period and can't understand why their weight fluctuates. Others would rather take a supplement than eat real food 🙈
.
.
These are some of the elements to think about when it comes to your goals - in no particular order 👊
.
.
My own Experience 
- I'm excellent with training and drinking water, I'm very good with nutrition and my sleep is decent. Performance is my goal. I felt like I wasn't fully recovering right - so instead of doing more - I've been training with my body. I'm back on creatine and I'm managing my stress 👊👌
.

Nutrition and exercise are not the only 2 elements you can control. If you have those nailed why not look at other areas? 🤔",41,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/154799382_119286780131929_8984058587896274225_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=EXsX8Azx_wwAX83ByJu&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfCISL_UQULbjtvFuwxfd9hga8bEHEfFR8jj1WQ5q3aSUw&oe=63D7C275,https://www.instagram.com/p/CL3vc7lhZvg/,17866313375364918,,,,

This will come as a shock to people.
.
.
Even when I was younger, I gave off the appearance of a confident person but deep down I suffered from really low self worth 😢
.
.
I was the exact replica of the majority of my clients and women in general:
.
✔ I put myself under too much pressure
✔ I tried to please everyone but myself 
✔ I based my self worth on my appearance
✔ I wanted to be perfect at everything
.
.
My game changed when my mental game changed.
.
🎯 I realised I was putting myself under huge unnecessary pressure. It was self inflicted and I needed to realise that
🎯 I stopped trying to please everyone else and put myself first
🎯 I don't base my self worth on how I look but what kind of person I am ❤
🎯 Perfection doesn't exist but I'm doing a damn good job at life
.
.
If your mental game is not strong, I can Promise you - no clothes size, weight target or 'ideal body' will feel good ❤ Start working on both your physical and mental health. Seek the help you need. Find something you can stick to long term 🙏 And enjoy life - we only get one 🙌

Consistency 👊

.
✔ I tried cheap products 
✔ I tried expensive products 
✔ I quit on it 
✔ I blamed all the products
✔ I blamed my hormones
✔ I blamed my diet
.
.
Then one day I decided to take it serious. I booked in for a consult with @advancedrejuvenationbondi. I started getting regular facials. I started listening to my body - training with it rather than against it. I reduced my stress levels. I reduced dairy from my diet. This was a process. It didn't all happen in one day. I took it step by step day by day. I was patient 🙈 (for once in my life). And now 6 months on, I'm reaping the rewards 🙏😍
.
.
Why am I telling you this?
I always compare my skin journey to others fitness journey.
Why?
❎ Most people try 10 different programmes but never stick to one
❎ Most people blame everyone and everything else for not achieveing their goals
❎ Most people are impatient

If you need help achieving your goals just reach out. Pm me.There is no shame in asking for help. You'll save yourself a lot of time in the long run 👊

1. You were not born to just consume and burn calories - you and your body are worth more than that
2. Instead of checking what calories you burned why not instead enjoy your training?
3. If reason 1 & 2 weren't enough, These trackers are so inaccurate 🤦‍♀️ So even if you do it just to see calories burned it's more than likely wrong.
4. Journalling the weights you are lifting and the reps and sets you are doing is so much more beneficial to your goals - no matter what they are 🤷‍♀️

.
.
People set their goals too high - it's a natural thing.
.
.
From an aesthetic perspective, we have all been raised with unrealistic expectations of what the 'perfect body' is. So of course people set their limits towards that. In most cases:
1. The person we want to look like doesn't actually look like their photoshopped photo
2. The measures they went to, to look like that are unhealthy and unattainable
.
.
From a fitness perspective, we go in all guns blazing expecting to train every day. Expecting an RPE of 8-10 on every session. Expecting to hit pbs everyday. Expecting training sessions to be fun and exciting and different and enjoyable.
1. If you are a person who doesn't exercise, commit to NO MORE than 3 sessions a week - 40 mins. Anything extra should be a bonus.
2. If body composition change is a goal, lift bloody weights - I'm sick of explaining all the reasons why.
3. Boring can be progressed. Progression = improvement. Stop trying to make it fancy.
.
.
From a nutrition perspective, we want to change our whole diet in a week which leads to.... Falling off the wagon altogether, saying fuck it  and starting that cycle 7 million times. What you should do:
1. Start small. Build habits. Imagine 1 habit a week over 12 weeks. No crazy changes just small incremental changes.
2. Instead of eliminating foods - add foods. Add colour, add protein, add water. 
3. 80/20 rule is and will always be my go to. 80% of the food your body needs, 20% of the food your body wants.
.
.
Support - Stop trying to do this all unassisted. If you're like me and love the support from your girls ❤ Find a gym buddy. If you need help with your goals invest in a coach 🙏",82,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/151355624_727629001285140_2360915475298375925_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=NZntJHHV3pwAX_Pwrsb&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfBTEAzFgjr7aQNSnV7SRudmaUCG7q5N3tcOHIm8DOuSlw&oe=63D79474,https://www.instagram.com/p/CLd_dQdB-ld/,17895953380822957,,,,
1,2021-02-18T07:22:17+0000,"I used to hate my small boobies....
I used to hate my teeth...
I used to hate my curly hair...
I always wanted to be smaller...
I wanted to be prettier...
I wanted to be smarter...
I wanted to be fitter...
I wanted to be lighter..
I wanted abs... 

I always wanted something more. I was never happy. But the problem wasn't in my appearance. The problem lay deep inside. I wasn't happy within myself. I didn't love myself or my body 😢 And this is something I see in 90% of women, a feeling of self loathing 😭 

I made changes. I changed how I viewed myself and my body. It took time. A long time. But finally I am at a place in my life that my exterior does not define me. I am living in a country where aesthetics is priority and most people have injected at least 1 part of their body 🙈😅 And here I am - delighted with my frizzy hair, my crooked teeth and my muscular legs 👊 

This is something I work on my clients with constantly. Stop trying to look for happiness in a clothes size, the bottom of a make up bottle, or the newest beauty trend. I can promise you no amount of beauty products fitness regimes or shopping can make you feel like self confidence feels 🙏

.
.
Quite often I hear people recommending high protein diets without having a clue why they are recommending it 🤷‍♀️
.
.
My clients know why I recommend up to 2g Protein/KG BW/day 🙌 Why? Because I educate them why 👊
.
.
1. TEF - Our total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) is made up for 4 components - BMR, NEAT, Purposeful Activity and TEF. It accounts for up to 10% of our TDEE. Protein rich foods have a higher thermic effect from food than any other macro nutrient.
.
2. Satiety - Protein is super filling. It's difficult to eat large quantities without feeling full. This is a good complaint 😜
.
3. Recovery - Protein is required for so many processes in our body. Regardless of your goals - weight loss, weight gain, performance - everyone will benefit from a high protein diet.
.
.

6,2021-02-08T21:30:34+0000,"Collette's Experience:

I have spent the last few days thinking about how I can put into words what the past 12 weeks have down for me. I started off with a particular goal in mind, it definitely hasn't ended up with that same goal!!! I wanted weight loss along with other things and I have lost very little but amazingly the weight loss is irrelevant to me. I haven't even looked at the scales in past 2 weeks. It's the journey that has happened internally that is my biggest achievement and I can honestly say i have never felt better, as Amanda has said so many times it doesn't matter what you look like on the outside if you're not happy on the inside you'll never be happy with how you look. I have achieved so many small personal goals, swimming in the sea on probably the coldest day of the year without worrying about how I looked to others, walking 10 Kms without even thinking about it and loving every single step. I have a very sedentary job and before I started there was days I didn't even get 2000 steps in, most definitely a thing of the past. But THE most important part of my 12 week journey is the fact that I am off all my medication for my mental health, no more anti depressants or anxiety tablets. 💪💪💪 This journey has taught me to make time for me, just me and as a result I'm a better mother, partner and work colleague because I am happier in me . My journey has just started and I can't wait to see where the next 12 weeks will bring me. From the bottom of my heart Amanda, Brian and all the girls on the coaching calls thank you for the wonderful support along the way

You are individual. You are not like anyone else, so why would you compare yourself to anyone else? 🤷‍♀️

Most of the time the circumstances aren't  even comparable. Let's give you some examples
❎ Comparing your image to celebrities 
❎ Comparing your performance to athletes
❎ Comparing your body to fitness influencers

✔ Start by setting some realistic goals
✔ Progression over perfection 
✔ Be consistent - stop giving it a short term tag. Look at the long term. Look at your future self.
✔ Find something you enjoy - you are more likely to stick to it

Aesthetics vs Performance 
.
.
Some of the differences include:
1. Calorie requirements may be different. 
Performance goals usually require maintenance calories or even a surplus depending on how active you are. Aesthetic goals usually require being in a calorie deficit.
.
.
2. Training looks different. 
Training for aesthetics is usually some bodybuilding format with some form of light cardio. Training for performance is usually sport specific like pitch training, strength sessions or even high volume sessions like CrossFit.
.
.
3. Nutrient profiles may be different.
Firstly, weight loss requires you to be in a calorific deficit. Technically, you could eat 1 Mars bar a day and lose weight. I wouldn't recommend it, but you'd achieve your goals. Where as if you tried to perform at your best for a sport on 1 Mars bar a day, I cannot imagine you'd be performing very well.
Nutrition for aesthetics can be as simple as calories in versus calories out. Nutrition for performance is much more intricate - do you have enough fuel? Are you recovering ok? Do you have a full nutrient profile? Are you consuming good fats for hormonal balance and recovery? 
.
.
These are some of the main differences in nutrition and training when you have different goals. Can you think of more? 🤔

.
.
I went through a really hard period of my life after my Dad died. As the oldest of his daughters I felt a responsibility to keep my shit together, look after my mother and sister and keep up appearances. It was a struggle. I tried to do this while managing a gym, commuting, playing with 2 football teams, studying, trying to maintain friendships and a relationship. I felt like I was just surviving as opposed to living 😢
.
.
And then I took control of my life. I started to look after myself first and everybody else's needs and wants came second. 
.
.
The meaning of the tattoo is that even the most beautiful things can come from the ugliest of places. 🙏
.
.
I'm not alone. I know we've all had struggles and strifes in our lives. I'm not saying mine has been harder than anyone else's. But I decided to take control of mine. I asked for help. I seeked the help I needed. And I made life changing decisions 💔❤

.
.
When lockdown occurred in Austrailia, one of the biggest habits people developed was daily alcohol drinking. And openly admitted when working from home, the time would get earlier and earlier 🙈
.
.
I am not anti alcohol. Actually I am the polar opposite. I encourage clients to have a glass of wine at weekends if that is what truely makes them happy. It's important to have balance in your life 🙏
.
.
I do believe though that alcohol is a little too readily available and can be 'too easy' to use as an escape. 
.
.
I implore people to find other things to pass their time. Exercise, walk, bake, knit, zoom call, cook, spring clean, learn a new skill ... the list goes on.

.
.
I can't explain it. But the feeling is like no other 🙌🤩 It is euphoric. Even as I sit writing this my hands are ripped open, I've rope burn on my legs and my calves feel every km I put in yesterday 😅 People think I'm crazy, I do understand why 😅🙈
.
.
But honestly I don't think I'd be me without this strength now. 
.
.
For years, my identity included football. People in my locality knew me as the footballer. But moving country helped remove that association 😅 Nobody I know over here even associates me with the sport 😅 But no one associates me with CrossFit. Last year I thought I wanted to get really serious about Crossfit. It was the competitive mindset 🙈 Going from one sport to another. 
.
.
But now, I'm just Amanda who trains. I like that ❤ No pressures. No stresses. No giving up a social 11am
life. Training when I want to. Working to better myself everyday.
.
.
And MOST IMPORTANTLY I train for performance as opposed to aesthetics. This was game changer for me. Its not everyone's goals I understand that but it certainly shifted my mindset towards myself and my body ❤
.
.
I am still taking on clients who want to get stronger improve performance, and become more confident. DM me for more details.

24,2021-01-11T21:14:30+0000,"Mindset Matters 🧠
.
.
Exercise and Nutrition are key to achieving your goals ✅
.
.
But so is mindset and it is an  element very often overlooked 🤔
.
.
For some people mindset is engrained. For me it was. I grew up as an athlete so exercise was a ready made component of my life. I didn't 'decide' when to exercise, it was decided for me. If I didn't eat right, I didn't perform well, I didn't make the team - the main goal. I trained with like minded people. So you could say things were easier for me. 🤷‍♀️
.
.
Easier than say:
- An overweight lady struggling her whole life to lose weight. Uncomfortable with her body but too uncomfortable to start exercising. Feeling tired and lethargic and her only support network is people in a similar situation who shame her into saying this is ok and normal.

- A skinny man who wants to add some muscle. He drinks a lot and dabbles in drugs. His friends are all the same and think he would be wasting money going to a pt. 
.
.
Without the right mindset and the right support network exercise and nutrition may just be too hard to sustain 🤷‍♀️
.
.
I work with athletes. But I also work with mothers who have never put themselves first. I work with women who have struggled their whole life with weight. I work with girls who are desperately anxious about how they look. Giving them a nutrition and exercise plan would be USELESS without educating them or helping them with the real WHY!!! 
.
.
I am so overwhelmingly happy to have so many amazing people on board at the moment. People who truely want to change their health for the better ❤
.
.
If you are one of these people DM me interested and we'll organise a call 😊🙌

Me too 🙋‍♀️

You see what my clients and I have in common is a lifestyle choice. One that makes Christmas, holidays and social events PART of our routine. We can enjoy occasions - without guilt. We also don't severly restrict ourselves getting back into normality. We don't do hours of endless cardio to burn extra calories. We simply get back to reality and pick up where we left off ☄☄☄

.
.
I used to compare myself all the time. Still do at times, it's only natural 🤷‍♀️
.
.
But I always assess my comparison. It's always fitness related 🙈 If I see someone fitter or stronger than me, I question how? It's an internal conversation....
.
.
More often than not it's one of 2 options.
1. They train more than me.
2. They have been training longer than me.
.
.
This is what it comes down to.
.
. 
NOT:
❌They take supplements I need
❌They eat a specific diet I need to eat
❌They do any fancy training I need to do

No they have simply been doing it longer or do it more often ✔ 
Basic and simple consistency ✔

First pic was actually just a flash no filter but it does show a smooth pair of tanned pins 🤣 Who do I think I am lol 🇮🇪👻
.
.
I actually never try hide my stretch marks (anyone who sees how little clothes I wear training will know this 😅)
.
.
I'm also proud of my stretch marks. Over the past 10 years I've gained over 10kg, it would be pretty impossible not to have stretchmarks. 🙈
.
.
These stretch marks represent a lot more  than weight gain.
.
.
To me they represent:
✅ My mindset change about my body
✅ My reminder of how good my relationship is with food
✅ How strong I have become - physically and mentally ❤
.
.
I have a love/hate relationship with instagram and the portrayal it represents  of 'perfect' bodies. I like to keep it real and remind you all stretch marks are 100% normal. Embrace them 🙏❤

✅Joined Crossfit - It's been in the pipeline for 2 years but I finally did it 🤣
✅ Overcame my fear of driving in a city 🤠
✅ Met new friends - thank you to every new person I have met and has made my experience in Austrailia so incredible.

I had a story up the other day about my own experience. And so many of you wanted to know more. Now luckily I am in a position where I have control over my training. I can reduce frequency and intensity when I need to. If you are an athlete, you may find this more difficult. But I cannot recommend enough to train with your body as opposed to against it. You should be able to speak to a coach or trainer about training intensity at different times.

This really could be a game changer for your training and your overall body composition. 💪💪💪

.
.
So is drinking, if that's what you choose to do 🍻 (as long as it's not negatively affecting your health)
.
.
I was so disappointed by how many people replied to my story saying they feel pressure to drink 😢
.
.
So what I have to say to this:
.
1. If you decide to not drink, don't mind other people's opinions. It has absolutely NO impact on them if you don't drink but it could negatively impact you (for whatever reason you have decided). 
.
2. Your goals will not always be the same as everyone else's. It's not that those people are trying to be rude, they just don't understand so don't take it too personally.
.
3. If you are one of the people saying 'Ah sure one won't hurt' - just think before you say it. I definitely was one of these in the past. But I've learned that sometimes we don't know or need to know why people chose not to drink.
.
.
Whatever you do just be kind. Be respectful of people's wishes. You have no right to question people on their reasoning - they deserve to have a choice. And same goes for sober Sallys - no judgement as long as people are consuming alcohol in a healthy manner 🙏
.

19,2020-12-11T10:04:08+0000,"Let's clear something up... 
.
.
There is no perfect form of coaching ❎
Or perfect form of exercise ❎
.
.
Each style has it's pros and cons 😈
.
.
But it is the form that you can consistently work with and that give you long term sustainable results - that works for you. That does not mean it works for everyone 🤔
.
.
Let me give you some scenarios.
.
.
One of my current online clients first approached me for in person PT. She didn't know I lived in Austrailia 🙈🤣 She wasn't interested in online coaching due to wasting money on previous online programmes. This lady works 2 jobs and barely has time for herself let alone fitting into a PT schedule. Online coaching was a great option for her. She is currently at her goal weight 11 weeks into the programme 🥳
.
.
I have a friend who tried online coaching...twice. First time went well, second time not as well. Nothing wrong with the programme, she just responds better to in person accountability. She is now doing in person PT and loving it 🥳
.
.
There's nothing special about Crossfit. It's more the community and the vibe than the exercise prescription people enjoy. 
.
.
Running may be an excellent form of exercise for an introvert but an extrovert might find it very isolating...
.
.
My point?
1. Just because Sharon got results from a PT does not mean that PT has extraordinary powers. This form of coaching got Sharon results because it was something she CONSISTENTLY did and could stick to.
2. There is no right or wrong coaching style - just what works for you. 
3. Please find something you enjoy and can see yourself doing for the next 50 years 🙏 As opposed to hating exercise, see it as a blessing 👏
.

I'd love to hear some of your experiences

A client said to me the other day.
'I'm really happy with how things are going. I don't think I'll ever love everything about myself but I'm in a much better place about my body'. I also don't feel guilty about food anymore.'
.
.
Same client in October (direct quote):
'I just feel ugly and probably compare myself too much to other people.'
.
.
2 months of healing. 2 months of working on her relationship with food. 2 months of enjoying the process. 
.
.
Imagine where she will be in 2 years? 🤔🤔🤔
.
.
I can tell you where because that client of mine was me. And I didn't have help. I didn't have guidance. It took me a hell of a lot longer because I did it alone.
.
.
I feel like sometimes being confident is mistaken for being cocky. Being happy in the skin you're in is not about thinking you are better or more beautiful than anyone else. 
.
.
👉 It's smiling - not because you have perfect teeth but because you have teeth
👉 It's about having a photo taken of yourself - not for the bloody gram 😔
👉 It's about knowing your body will never be perfect - because perfection does not exist
👉 It's understanding food is fuel 
👉 It's finding that exercise you love and enjoying it
👉 It's about comparing you to you - nobody else 🚫
.
.
It's a journey and a process but the final destination is an amazing one 🙏❤ 
.

If you want help in finding that inner confidence and finally achieving internal happiness. Dm me 'Get Started'.

Why wait until After Christmas to start coaching? 🤔
.
.
I am NOT providing a quick fix. I won't have clients dropping 10lbs in 4 weeks before Christmas. Everything I do is long term and sustainable. That is why my clients are staying with me OVER Christmas 🌲 
.
.
If you want:
- A good relationship with food and nutrition
- Sustainable results
- Accountability - (not one email a week - proper coaching calls)

I signed up to do @thetribalthrowdown in August and was so excited to do my first ever intermediate comp 🥳
.
.
The very next day I dislocated my left knee cap.

.
The first day I went to physio, I asked him would I be able to compete. He said: 'We'll use it as a goal'. I wasn't too optimistic 😢🙈
.
.
12 weeks later. There was a change to the structure due to lockdown but Ryan and the gang handled it brilliantly. I completed every wod and minus a terrible wod 1, I am absolutely delighted with how it went. Beyond proud to have achieved my initial goal of top 10 😭
.
.
As proud as I am of myself, I'm even prouder of the AMAZING ladies who did this comp with me. And massive congrats @szczygielklimska outright winning the comp 💪Solidifying my love for Crossfit and the people involved in it.

Thank you @thetribalthrowdown. I'm sure this has helped people over the last 4 weeks more than youll even know.

👉 You're trying to reduce sugary snacks but the kids treats are calling to you from the kitchen cupboards 🤦‍♀️

CONSISTENCY 🔑
.
.
How do we stay consistent?
Finding something we enjoy and can sustain 🙏
.
.
If you don't see yourself doing it a year from now. It's not sustainable or something you enjoy 🚫
.
.
If you are someone who hates running but your friend Mary lost 2 stone from pounding the pavements so you plan on starting....
Find something else. Please 😑
.
If you love carbs but everyone tells you keto is the best weight loss diet. Keto may not be the best option for you. 🥩
.
If you've never cycled over 5km in your life but you 'want to challenge yourself' and sign up to a triathlon without training. You my friend are a lunatic. 🚴‍♀️
.
.
I'm going to give you a success story. Not a client of mine. But my boyfriend. Owen has been training for years and years. He's dipped in and out. Trained hard 5 days a week for weeks, then nothing. He's never been consistent. During lockdown in March, Owen started coaching with @komplexfitness. Owen is now approximately 7-8 months consistently training (he missed 1 session - due to a severe hangover 😅).
.
Owen is the strongest he's ever been and he looks great. Why?
- He enjoys his training. 
- He can fit it into his lifestyle. 
- Kevin is obviously an alright coach 😜😅
.

.
.
People can't believe it when I tell them I've only consistently been doing Crossfit since March. 
.
.
What they don't see is the 6 years of CONSISTENT strength training. The 18 years of football training. My capacity is big. I've been training for a long time. 
.
.
I wouldn't say I'm a keg now but I've a pretty big glass. The bigger the glass, the easier everything becomes. It's the reason a balanced lifestyle is easier for me than Mary who needs to lose a stone. My glass is bigger. Therefore, my lean muscle mass is bigger. Therefore, this has a positive impact on my BMR. Hence, I can eat chocolate and get away with it while Mary just needs to look at Chocolate and she has gained 2lbs. 
.
.
Work on making the glass bigger. Everything else will come 🙏

What happens if you don't lose weight one week? Does it undo all the hard work you've done? All the consistent effort you've made. All the new habits you've built. Or what if your weight plateaus? Does this mean you quit and give up? 🤷‍♀️
.
.
We are all impatient humans. And we want to be rewarded for our hard work. And that's fair. But success does not happen overnight in any industry so why would weight loss be different. 🚫
.

Consistency is key. Finding a method that works for your goals but that you also enjoy - making it sustainable. And don't forget about all the good habits you are making. If you made one good habits each week for a year, that'd be 52 good habits. ✅ Keep up the great work 🥳

Sometimes within competition you find a lot of people's values and morals drop as a person just to beat someone else. Just because you want to do your best at something, doesn't mean you can or have the right to tear down someone elses attempt to be the best. Another reason I love CrossFit. I'm happy when I do well but I'm as happy when my partner or friend does well. Even if they 'beat me' I am not bitter or even disappointed. The only time i am disappointed is if I think I  can do more.

I am not where I want to be. But I am a hell of a lot closer than I was 2 years ago. If you want to compare yourself to me, why not compare these stats:
👉 I have been playing intercounty football for over 10 years
👉 I have on average been in the gym 4 days a week for over 6 years. That is 1300 gym sessions. 
👉 I have drank 2L water at least 95% of the time for the last 10 years.
👉 I have a healthy balanced diet - no extremes of diet and binge - for about 6 years (not including the picky years 😅)
👉 Up until this year, I have drank very IRREGULARLY.

18,2020-11-09T19:35:27+0000,"🌟Let's talk periods and training 🌟
.
.
Firstly, I am so happy with how normal it now is to talk about periods 🙏 Secondly, having a period is such a good thing and I think until you've lost it, you'll never realise how good it is to have it. (P.s I've never lost mine. Just through client's experiences)
.
.
I'm going to start off with the fact that until this week I have never ever followed the information I'm about to give you. But after my nightmare training week last week, I promise my body I will now train WITH my cycle and not against 🙌 I'm pretty happy I have an excuse as to why my performance was so poor last week 😅🙈
.
.
So here are just some of the things going on within your body:

Follicular Phase

● Increase in estrogen = increase in strength
● Increase in pain threshold
● Increase in insulin sensitivity = increased efficiency in burning carbs
● Muscle recovers well = get training

Ovulation Phase

● Increase in all hormones including testosterone
● Up to 11% increase in strength
● Increase in estrogen
● Increase in metabolism = increase in appetite 
● Water retention & bloating can occur

Luteal Phase

● Decrease in estrogen & progesterone
● Decrease in serotonin = PMS starts to kick in
● Increase in water retention
● Increase in body temperature
● Decreased quality in sleep
● Craving sugar
● Not a good time to do measurements
● Best to avoid max training / PB’S

Menstrual Phase

● PMS starts to subside
● Experience cramping
● Reduction in body temperature
● Increase in energy
● Insulin sensitivity starts to increase
.
.
Taper your training to your cycle. It doesn't mean you have to lie in bed for 2 out of 4 weeks. Sometimes it's hard to talk to a coach or trainer about these things but you HAVE to listen to your body.
.
.
I have tried for too long to think I am invincible. That I can train hard 365 days a years. It's BS. And at almost 30 I am finally starting to realise I need to listen to my body and my cycle. Thankfully I copped on before losing it 🙏❤

.
.
Old news I know 🤣
.
.
I got so many people asking why? 
.
.
So here it is. 
.
.
When I started in the fitness industry, I was a footballer. I actually wanted it to be cleanandleangaagirl but a friend veered me away from it saying it'd narrow my audience. 7 years ago I ate super clean. I still believe in natural wholefoods, I am still a huge advocate but I don't eat clean full time 🤣 I'm much more about that balanced lifestyle. Finally, being lean is NOT important to me anymore. It's not a goal, it's not something I work towards and it's not a word I want associated with me.
.
.
Where do I see myself now?
I see myself as a coach. I truely believe I have helped a lot of people over the last 7 years. I've helped people in A LOT of ways. I don't call myself a pt or a nutritionist but a combo of both. I've changed people's lifestyles which to me is a lot more important than any meal plan or training programme I can prescribe. I absolutely love my job. I love helping people and I'm so happy to call this my job. 
.
.
In short, I no longer play sport, I don't eat clean 100% of the time and I'm not worried about being lean 🤣 I am however a coach. A good one at that, and thats what I want to be recognised as 😁

Honestly, why do we feel the need to over complicate nutrition so much 🤯
.
.
👉 Please realise everyone is different. What works for you may not work for someone else.
👉 Instead of REMOVING everything (gluten, dairy, etc. Etc.) Start adding in
Water, colour, protein
👉 Counting calories is not essential to weight loss but being in a calorie deficit is.
👉 Food is fuel. Load up on the good stuff, reduce the processed stuff and never deem foods as good or bad.

.

.

This approach has been game changer with my clients. It's slower but so much more sustainable.

.

.

I do it in relation to nutrition,training and mindset.

.

.

Without a doubt, its impact on nutrition is invaluable. It teaches people to slow down when it comes to nutrition. Making them realise its not all about 0 to 100. There are ALOT of numbers in between there 😅 It's simple and relatively easy. 

.

.

Examples include: Drinking 2L water consistently EVERY DAY. Eating vegetables with lunch. Treat every second day. 

.

.

It also works for movement. 10,000 steps daily is a habit. I have clients who nail this daily. And clients who STRUGGLE!!! But having that target helps them move more than without a target. Quite often if I have someone hitting 1000 Steps a day, I won't throw an unrealistic target of 10,000 on their back. Ill start with 2-3k. Hit that for a week great. Increase to 4,000. Hit that EVERY day. Great. Increase again. And so on. NEW HABIT BUILT! You need wins along the way. Otherwise you will quit. Make things achievable.

.

.

Same goes for mindset. Journaling, meditation and reading Are all great habits to work on with clients. 

.

.

Here are some of my habits I'm planning over the next 6 weeks. I've  already nailed the basics so that's why I'm jumping. Please don't jump until youve the basics nailed 😅

.

.

Week 1 - No alcohol ✅

Week 2 - Intermittent Fasting 

Week 3 - Fruit or veggies at every meal

Week 4 -No bread or chocolate

Week 5 - Fizzy drinks only at weekends

Week 6 - Full clean week - No processed food

1. Single Leg RDL
2. Banded Good Morning
3. Knight Stretch 
4. Inchworm

Preparing my hamstrings and  working on that hinge position are 2 things I focus on pre Deadlift. I also do some sort of upper body activation to get my back muscles ready for the lift, usually some sort of scapula Hang and banded row 👌

I've spent so much time trying to improve it...

Years and years...

I've bought hundreds of cheap products essentially WASTING money...

I've even bought expensive products that were not the right fit for my skin...

I told myself I cared. But really I didn't. I wasn't committed to a regime. When I didn't see results after 6 weeks I would try something different 🙈

I'm 29 and have finally invested in a routine that suits my skin 🙏 But Admittedly i have wasted YEARS of my life trying to rectify this situation myself...

I couldnt do it by myself.. I tried...

For years...

Sound familiar to your fitness journey? 
❌Trying for years and STILL not where you want to be?❌

Speaking from experience, it's not necessarily the most expensive product but the product that works for you. You NEED to give it time. Doing it alone without knowledge WILL NOT work... I am speaking from experience.

I spent years hating my skin. Uncomfortable in it. But doing NOTHING about it. Stop doing that in your body 🚫

.
.
Nothing to do with this pandemic. But just our day to day lives 😔
.
.
On Saturday I got Owen to take a picture of me with a white light on me just to look better 😢 Turned out I actually looked even nicer with no bright light (the above photo). This is common for people, I know. But not for me. I pride myself on NOT being like that. I believe in loving yourself warts and all. I've never used editing apps (I can barely use a filter 😅). But I did this. Why? To get a few extra likes? Maybe a few extra followers? 
THAT IS NOT ME 😭
.
.
Also on Saturday, someone tried to sabotage an event @acountydownunder was organising. Let me explain the nature of the event.
Bringing people together in Sydney from all parts of the world, to be united during these tough times. Can you believe someone could do that? I was appauled😢
.
.
Finally, on Saturday. I met the most incredible bunch of ladies who I would have never met, if it weren't for Facebook and Instagram 🙏
.
.
The point to this post... ?
A lot happened on Saturday 😅
.
.
No.
.
.
Social media and the world today can be an amazing platform for meeting new people, sharing likeminded opinions and general positive messages.
.
.
But there is a nasty side. One that is jealous of other people's success. One that changes you to be someone you are not 😢
.
.
You do have a choice.
.
.
If social media is negatively impacting you. Delete it. If you follow someone who impacts how you feel about yourself, unfollow them.
.
.
I plan on reducing my screen time as I think it's negatively impacting me a little. It doesn't mean I'm leaving - far from it. I just plan on occupying my time with things I've been neglecting like Mobility, Podcasts and reading 🙏
.
.
Use social media for good ❤

.

.

I can be almost certain if you go on a date with a guy, he doesn't ask what you weigh 🤭 If he does, I dunno if a second date should be on the cards 😅🙈

.

.

Sexiness and body confidence is not:

✖ A number on a scales

✖ A dress size

✖ A certain body fat percentage

✖ Free from cellulite or stretch marks

✖ Filters

✖ Super fit or unfit

✖The loudest or quietest person in the room

✖With make up or without

.

.

Confidence is how you perceive yourself. It's a smile. It's being happy in the clothes your wearing. Happy in the company of others. Comfortable in your relationship. It's being happy in your own skin with and without beauty products. It's exercising and eating well because you want to not becauae you have to.

.

.

Confidence is beautiful ❣
.

Confidence is something I really work on with my clients in all elements of their life 👌 It can be a battle and with most it takes weeks to months to instill in them but tthat feeling of self worth and improved self esteem IS LIKE NO OTHER ❤

2 - 8 Variety of bridges, hip opening exercises, variations of squats and walks.

Movements should be geared towards the exercises you are doing in the session. They should help 'activate' the muscles you will be using in the training session.

This may help if you are still just doing starjumps or the treadmill to warm up 🙈

.
.
Which is best?
.
.
Answer is.
.
.
Neither are better, neither are worse.
.
.
I eat both. But why you are eating it depends on your goals 👊👊👊
.
.
✅ Weight loss a goal? Cauliflower rice is low in calories and high in volume so may be a great option
✅Alternatively, portion control of brown rice can also work.
✅ Performance a goal? You will not get the same complex carbs from caulifower rice as you will from brown rice. 
✅ Both have different nutritional compositions when it comes to vitamins and minerals.
✅ Taste? Force feeding yourself cauliflower rice because your favourite fitness influencer recommended it? YOU ARE JUST BEING STUPID!!!! 
.
.
There is no right or wrong answer to comparing these. As always, it is dependent on your individual goals and anyone that gives you a clear defined answer is a fruad 😅🚫

.
.
I've had a fair few of them over here 🙈 I'm a social butterfly at the moment🦋 😅 These are some of my ways to combat them, so you can still stay social and not ruin all your progress 🙋‍♀️
.
.
1. Pre plan your food. THIS IS 90% OF PEOPLE'S downfall....
They order takeaway or uber eats. Or both...twice. That craving can be satisfied with a homemade pizza
Or taco chips or even a ready made my muscle chef meal 🤗 Stop ruining your progress because you're eating like an asshole after alcohol.
.
.
2. Sleep as much as you can that night. Enough said. 😴
.
.
3. Drink 2L water. Seems very obvious. But how many of us actually do it? Add an electrolyte. Add cordial if you don't like water. Make it a soda water? I don't care just get 2L in 💦
.
.
4. If you do want a fizzy drink, please for the love of God don't waste your calories on the sugary options. At least have sense to go for a 0 Cal alternative 🤦‍♀️
.
.
5. Move. It doesn't have to be a gym session. It doesn't need to be intense. Aim for your 10,000 steps or a little ocean swim. Your body will thank  you  for it 🙏
.
.
If all else fails, just go on the rollover...

.
.
I had a poll on this a few weeks ago and a majority of people voted they agree with it.
.
.
Lets be totally clear on the context. It was training WITH an injury. Not training THROUGH an injury. Very different. 
.
.
However, it is not uncommon to train through an injury either. I want to be clear here. I am NOT telling you to train with an injury. This is very individual dependent and requires advice from a professional I.e Doctor, physio etc.
.
.
✅Training with an injury

👉 Anyone who knows me, knows how much of an advocate I am of this. When I injure lower body, upper body is still very much manageable, however, I am careful not to put too much pressure on affected area

👉 Mental Health - I don't know about the rest of you but mental health is one of my main reasons for training so if I had to sit still I'd cry 😩

👉 Socialising - It can be a tough time going through an injury. If you are a sports player it can be so isolating 😢 Being able to do something in th gym, in a class or with your team can have a huge impact on your mindframe ❤

➡️ Training through an injury

🚫 Only do under advice from your healthcare professional (But a little bit of important info is there actually is evidence to suggest you can)

✅ Nutrition with an injury
⛔ Most overlooked aspect of recovery in my opinion

👉 Fats are anti inflammatory and a vital part of the healing process 

👉 Protein as ALWAYS is King 🤴

👉 Calories will need to be adjusted for activity levels

➡️Remember Recovery does not just mean 'rest

❤I love the feeling of pushing yourself to be better every single day.

❤As annoying as it can be, I love that my body doesn't have a clear size anymore. I can range from a 6 to a 12, a small to a large 😅 It feels so good to not let a number define me.

But I also love:

💕To dress up at the weekend

💕To go out for dinner with Owen

💕To enjoy drinks with friends

It doesn't HAVE to be one or the other.

It doesn't HAVE to be so hard.

You can have your cake and eat it.

But maybe you just need help? Maybe you need to be nicer to yourself? Maybe you need to be educated? Maybe you need support. Maybe you need to train less? Maybe you need to train more?

Major Fomo seeing the results from this years @midlandsthrowdown. Such an incredible event that I'm so glad went ahead at the weekend 🙌
.
.
Some of the reasons I love Crossfit:
👉 The encouragement is like something I've never seen before
👉 You can never be good at everything. 
👉 The feeling of accomplishment when you achieve a new skill is unbelievable
👉 The people you meet through the sport 🙏❤
.
.
I am going back to Crossfit today and I am so bloody excited 😍🙏 @orlac_fit 3  weeks now to prepare for @thetribalthrowdown 💪💪💪
(I've accepted it won't be my best comp after being injured the last 5 weeks but even to be able to compete I would be happy ❤)

👊 Don't eat like an asshole. You don't NEED 10,000 calories the next day. Try get back to a normal routine. It doesn't have to be kale smoothies but get your  normal rotuine back. Decent breakfast, protein in every meal and lots of micros.

The day after drinking doesn't have to be perfect. But just stay consistent. A lot of my clients love to socialise and want to be able to incorporate it into their lifestyle.

.

.

Mindset is more than half the battle when it comes to our goals. Ever hear the saying 'the body achieves what the mind believes '.

.

.

I firmly believe a positive attitude helps the body and mind in more ways than you can even imagine 🙏

.

.

Begin each day with something positive. This sets your body and mind up for the whole day

.

.

My morning Ritual:

💥 NOT snoozing my alarm - when my phone buzzes at 5am. I am up with bells on. (Yes I am an annoying morning person)

💥I have my  bag packed and breakfast made from the night before - so I am organised and not rushing and racing

💥My morning coffee - unfortunately I dont get the time to sit on social media and reflect on my morning coffee thoughts 😅 (but i still have them)

💥Morning bootcamps or client coaching calls start my day the right way

.

.

I find things i am grateful for EVERY SINGLE DAY. I may not jot them down but I have them. (If it's not already obvious this man is certainly one of them 💕)

.

.

Something I get my clients to do is physically write them down. 3 a day. It can be something as simple as morning coffee to being proud you've overcome cancer. Its relative to you. No one else.

.

.

Try it for a week and see the difference in your attitude.

.

.

If you are not willing to work on your mind, good luck working on your overall health 🚫

I haven't always had a flexible approach to Nutrition. I too, struggled with #balance. 
.
.
It took me a long time to understand how important a balanced lifestyle truely is. Not just from a physical perspective but more so from a mental and social perspective. 🙏
.
.
My clients know there are no 'off limits' foods. Treats are recommended. But that being said I'm not of the opinion that a calorie is a calorie and all calories are created equal. I still recommend a diet of mostly whole and minimally processed foods. I believe in the 80/20 approach and this works very well for my clients 😍

I wasn't being lazy or greedy but I lacked knowledge and experience.

I was never the best footballer. But what I lacked in skill, I gained in fitness. I initially doubted my ability. But as soon as I boosted my confidence and improved my self belief, I became a decent footballer. I believed in myself and that's what led me to play with Roscommon Intermediate Ladies for 10 years and be part of 2 interpro Connacht panels.

.
I will never be remembered for my shooting skills. I am being open and honest here. I cannot help you with that. But apart from my pink hair band I will be remembered for 1. My strength and 2. My engine.

So one of the things I harp on about constantly as a nutritionist is trying to get more vegetables in my client's diet 🥦🥒🍄

.

.

But did you know how you cook your veggies can have an impact on it's nutritional status? For example: when boiling vegetables you may lose a lot of the vitamins in the water. Roasting vegetables can actually change the glycaemic index of a food. And any cooking method  can cause loss of fibre from the vegetables.

. 

.

What does this mean?

Get a variety of vegetables in your diet. And a variety of different cooking methods 

E.g A salad for lunch and roast veggies for dinner

Or Raw Spinach for breakfast and a stirfy for lunch

👉👉👉Tag someone who eats the same food constantly 🙈

.
.
Why do we only think about everything in the short term?

- Body Appearance

- Health  

- Alcohol and diet

- Drugs

- Having the latest brands

- Photos for the gram

What do all of the above have in common? We focus on the short term and not long term. 

Examples:

The long term effects of yo yo dieting on the body. 
.
Alcohol/Drugs/Poor food choices all evoke a short term satisfaction that long term can lead to serious health implications. 
.
Living beyond your means and 'having the latest trends' can have you in serious debt long term.

I actually know of people with the perfect Instagram account who are suffering from Depression

Does the future ever enter your mind?

.
.
💥Fitness is no longer about being fit but rather 'looking fit'💥
.
.
💯When I became a trainer, I too was obsessed with the quest for the perfect body. Small waist, big bum, abs..
.
.
💢Not necessarily because I actually wanted these things but because thats what i thought being 'fit' was. I associated fitness with aesthetics and beauty. And let's call a spade a spade, most fitness influencers look flawless at all times. 
I could have easily ended up going down this route. On the constant search for beauty and perfection.
.
.
💢But I enjoyed 'being fit' too much. Being fit includes: inappropriate sweat patches, a red face and HARD WORK!!! While others focused on their booty poses and dieted until they see 'perfect abs' , I got fitter. And Fitter. And now, im the fittest Ive ever been (injury and all)
.
.
🚫Im very disappointed at how 'fitness' has turned into a beauty contest because that is NOT what it is. Fitness comes in all shapes and sizes with varying different levels. 
.
.
⚠️I remember a time when I was a teenager where fitness was just associated with how aerobically fit you were? How strong you were? How fast you were? How much you've progressed and improved?
I'd like to go back to this.⚠️

.
.
Yes I am extremely happy in Austrailia. 
.
.
Let me tell you how lucky we've been.
👉 We got all our travelling in before COVID hit 
👉 We got to spend time with my sister and her boyfriend before we moved to Sydney
👉 We got into the country just before the country went into lockdown
👉 I lost a job and gained the one I'm currently in during lockdown
 .
.
I genuinely believe in things happening for a reason and us getting here just before the country went into lockdown happened for a reason. At the moment, there are so many things we cannot do. So many changes. Life is not exactly the same. But that doesn't mean we cant be grateful for what we have ❤

.
.
What I see:
👉 Carbs - sourdough bread
👉 Fats - avocado, goats cheese, haloumi
👉 Protein - goats cheese, haloumi
👉 Vitamins and minerals

.
What someone else may see:
👆 Healthy Breakfast
. 
.
What someone doing weight watchers may see:
👆 A lot of 'syns'
.
.
What someone counting macros and calories may see:
💣 A lot of calories 
.
.
Remember, food is different for everyone. Everyone's goals are different. What's 'right' for one person may be 'detrimental' to another person. Not everybody has a good relationship with food. Actually from my experience, most people have a terrible relationship with food. 
.
.
So I suggest, unless someone asks for help or advise; refrain from commenting on people's food habits. You have no idea what can of worms you may be opening up.

If you want to heal your relationship with food and understand nutrition better pm me 😁

Balance isn't always about an 80/20 rule. Balance isn't the same for every one. 
.
.
Sometimes balance is bloody hard. It took me years to find balance. And now I still question if I have it. Instead of being too strict, am I now being to lenient?

.
.
Balance can cause anxiety for people. 
.
.
How are some people able to eat pizza and still remain lean? I eat 100% clean and still can't see changes? 😢 Do I have enough protein in my diet? Do I drink too much? Is low calorie Ice cream or no ice cream the best option? How many steps should I be taking? What exercise is best? Is rest important?
.
.
My opinion: If it works towards your goals, do it. If not, don't!!!

There is no right or wrong. Just what's right for you 👆

.
.
Currently sitting at my heaviest EVER weight. I don't actually normally weigh myself but I had to get it done for something.
.
.
If I used scale weight to objectify my progress I think it's safe to say I'd be pretty darn disappointed 😂 But I don't.
.
.
A scale weight does not determine my worth. It doesn't signify how fit I am. It doesn't show how strong I am (it does however make it harder to do pull ups 🙈). It doesn't have any relevance to how hard I work or my job. So why would I let one number determine my happiness?
.
.
Those extra few kilos are the memories I've made. Those extra few kilos are the weekends that I've enjoyed more than ever before. Those extra few kilos are able to lift some extra weight.
.
.
So please, before you let a scale number determine your happiness, think about what that number actually means. To me, it means freedom. 🙌

.
.
It’s not about being positive and motivated constantly. It’s about turning up and being consistent even when you don’t want to be 🤕
.
.
Last week was a nightmare for me. Honestly, I am probably the fittest I’ve ever been. I had signed up for City to Surf and an online CrossFit comp at the end of October and what happens!? I dislocate my bloody knee 😩🙈 
.
.
Damage done on the Wednesday. Balled crying Wednesday night. DID NOT emotionally eat. Stuck to the plan. And I was back in the gym Thursday 💪🤟🏼 
.
.
My nutrition is absolutely key 🔑 I am a firm believer the reason I have bounced back from injuries previously is due to my nutrition ✅ 
.
.
Where did I get this attitude from?! I got it from my Daddy ❤️ My poor Dad suffered for the last 18 months of his life and you would never know it, because he never complained ❤️🥺 His attitude showed me important the right attitude can be 🤗🥰
.
.
So for now, I’m goblet squatting 10kg to a ball. But soon, I’ll be back where I was. And further 😉 
.
.
I hope this motivates someone else today 🙏🏻

Save if your looking for some inspo. But be aware doing random unstructured sessions are probably NOT the best option for progression. Thats why I don't post them very often 🙈😅

.
.
Don't knock it till you've tried it 👊
.
.
I've been hit with obstacles this week and many reasons to emotional eat but I've stayed strong. I feel better when I eat better so I decided to even improve my sweet treats 😊
.
.
Carob tastes similar to chocolate but is naturally caffeine free with low amounts of fat and sugar. It also contains fibre and antioxidants. It has twice the amount of calcium than cocoa and contains potassium, magnesium and B group vitamins 😊 
.
.
A lot of you may have tried choc shot before. Thats made from carob. You probably won't find it innthe supermarkets but may need to head to a health food shop 😝 
.
.
What are your favourite healthier alternatives? 🤔

👉Don't use it, you lose it.
.

I don't talk about mobility much. I don't post about it. It's not very visually appealing. It definitely won't get as many likes or shares as me in a bikini or a swim suit for that matter 😅🤪
.
.
But it bloody matters... 
.
.
❎ Can't touch your toes? Keep trying.
❎ Can't go below parallel in a squat? Keep squatting.
❎ Working at a desk with aches and pains. It takes 10 minutes.
❎ Lower back issues or hip problems? Have you tried this. 
❎ Guess what running in NOT bad for your knees. The WAY you are running is bad for your knees.
❎ Ever tried to do physio rehab. It's BLOODY HARD!!! 
.
.
My new goal is to get back to my previous 30 minute sessions daily. Its pretty manageable 10 mins in the am, 10 mins pre gym and 10 mins in the evening. I just have to stop making excuses. I use the @gowod_mobilityfirst app👌😁

4,2020-08-26T05:10:32+0000,"A high protein diet is optimal no matter what your goals are. Why?
.
.
✅ Protein is essential for recovery especially from exercise, illness or injury
✅ Protein saties you. It gives you a 'fuller' feeling. No matter what your goals, feeling more satisfied is a good thing right?
✅ The Thermic Effect of Protein is high. So it actually contributes to our overall TDEE. This is why a calorie is not just a calorie. Food type and nutrient composition is important 😁
.
.
I recommend 2g/kg BW/day. People find this hard to hit especially without supplements. So here is an idea of what 150g of protein looks like in a day 😊
(P.s I would not recommend tuna everyday due to heavy metals.)

.
.
I'm pretty consistent with my daily routine.
✅ I eat mostly whole, nutritious foods
✅ I train 5-6 days a week
✅ I average 17,000 Steps daily
✅ I drink 3L water (at least)
.
.
My weekends are becoming too enjoyable these days 🤪😅 So while I definitely want some leniancy at weekends, I don't want all my hard work to go to waste to wake up Monday feeling groggy and bloated 😵😵😵 
.
.
My New Habitual Goals:
1. Alcohol once every 3 weeks 
2. Treats every 3-4 days (not daily)
3. Fizzy drinks at weekends only
4. 1 Uber Eats a month
P.s I also think I've signed up for a run 🙈 
. 
My first one and it's 14km 🤪😵 
.
.
To be totally honest, this shouldn't be hard for me. I did this all the time when I lived Ireland. But over here it's very easy to let bad habits creep in 🙈 There's definitely a YOLO approach to life in Sydney 😅 And while I'm constantly striving for 'balance' It's important to me to not tip the scales in the other direction and end up over indulging all the time 🚫🚫🚫

7,2020-08-19T06:30:56+0000,"I am a strong woman 🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️
.
.
Yes in the physical sense. I have worked for years to get stronger and build a body I feel confident in. I have consistently trained for the last 10 years. First at intercounty football which then led to my love of strength and resistance training😁 My body is a reflection of that.
.
.
But I am so much stronger than my physique. My mental strength is something you cannot see, but it's much stronger than any weight I could lift. Or any competition I'll do. 
I have gone through more than most will go through in a lifetime. I have had my own share of mental health issues. But I have come out the other side. A true reflection of my mental strength.
.
.
I have worked damn hard to be in the position I am in right now. I said to a client yesterday how lucky I am to have got a job during COVID and how amazing my job, clients and boss are. And she said 'Amanda, you are not lucky. You've worked for this.' She was right. 
.
.
It's an amazing feeling to feel like a strong woman. A strong woman can be intimidating. A strong woman can come off as bossy. A strong woman can get a hostile response especially from the opposite sex. And this is where I acknowledge the strong men in my life. Most notably my Dad was the strongest man I've ever known. Owen has the patience of a saint. And final shout out to the men I've worked with who were not immasculated taking orders from a woman and the bosses I've had who not only considered my opinion but actually valued it. 🙏

9,2020-08-17T06:12:32+0000,"It took my Dad dying 5 years ago for me to finally find true happiness...
.
.
Not that I wasn't happy before that. But his death made me question everything. I really went on a journey of self discovery 🙏
.
.
Just because you are living doesn't mean you're truely alive ❤
.
.
So what changed when my Dad died:
1. I appreciated life so much more ❤ Life is precious and a gift.
. 
2. I discovered travel - I always thought I didn't want to travel. I believed I was a home bird and I didn't need it. My trip to Thailand with the girls was a game changer. I cannot thank my friends enough for helping me find travel.
.
3. Fell in love with myself - I was ridiculously self conscious. I don't have good skin so I always covered it up. I don't like my teeth so I wouldn't smile properly in pictures. I stopped focusing on all the negative aspects of my appearance.
.
4. I stopped caring about what people think of me. I remember years ago saying to my sister: how will you cover up those tattoos on your wedding day? And she replied: She loved them and she'll want them to be seen. I had this perception in my head that tattoos were 'unattractive' and should be covered up. I now see them as self expression and see my body as a canvas 🙏
.
5. I stopped working towards what I considered success to be. I remember after college I was so embarrassed that I worked in a restaurant. I was a fully qualified nutritionist working in a restaurant. I believed I was too good to work in that restaurant. Why? Because my peers and societal norms led me to believe I was better than that. I worked so hard for a good Leaving Cert to be top 10 in my school. Why? Because that's what everyone else did. The last few years I have been so content in my work, not because of how much money I earn but because I truely love my job. I don't put pressure on myself to be something I'm not.
.
6. I quit looking for a perfect body - When I was a teenager, I thought skinny was the perfect body type. My early 20s - lean was 'IN'. I now realise there is no such thing as a perfect body. But I'm happy in the one I'm in.
.
7. I stopped comparing myself to people - comparison truely is the thief of joy.

.
.
It's the weekend 🎉🎉🎉
.
.
My body and I are very excited to have a weekend off socialising 😅 
My plans:
🤩 Work
🤩 Train
🤩 Yoga 
🤩 New Ink 
🤩 Recouperate 
.
.
What are your plans? Do they align with your goals? Are they getting you closer to where you want to be? Or are they forcing you to take a step back!? 🤔
.
.
Let's think about this. 
.
.
💣If your goal is to get leaner or lose body fat. Are you:
🤥 Eating protein based meals at the weekend
🤥 Drinking 2L+ water daily
🤥 Getting 70,000+ Steps weekly
❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓
.
.
If the answer is no. Don't forget that  the weekend is a NOT a free for all. 
.
.
If you have been tracking calories and have banked some for the weekend. Well done ✅ But if you are just Good Monday to Friday - you are fighting a losing battle. Stop STARTING all over again on Monday. Stop being at war with food, exercise and your body 🚫🚫
.
.
It IS possible to eat chocolate, drink  alcohol and eat food in a nice Restaurant. But you need education. You need to improve your relationship with food. You need to change your mindset.

(They may or may not have all made the cut, damn insta having to make me shorten videos 🐒)

More importantly swipe left and see where I started. It literally took blood, sweat and tears to get where I am now with my Double Unders 😅 And it took months. Not days or weeks. Months. And I still believe I've a long way to go. But I'm a lot closer than I was this time last year 💪💪💪
.

Think of this in relation to your own fitness goals. Think of how much further you could be this time next year? How much stronger? Fitter? Leaner? There's never a perfect time to start!!! But the Main thing I will say is just stay consistent. Initially, you'll be hitting PBs, running faster or being able to move better. There WILL be plateaus. You will get bored at times 🤪🙈Or frustrated or both 🙉

I think I'm pretty open and honest. Always have been. I might put the odd filter on to make me look more tanned but I actually don't know how to use Photoshop Or Change my appearance to look good for an Insta post 😅🤪 I am not the type of person who dresses in lingerie and poses to make her butt look good. I know I could get 10 times the followers if I sexualised my content. But that is not me, nor the role model I want to be 🙏

'Oh well you're just not in a calorie deficit'
Well you know Sharon it's not always that simple 🤨
.

What can also have an impact on total daily energy expenditure:
💥 The type of food you eat - the thermic effect of food has an impact on our TDEE
💥 Endocrine System - hormones and hormonal imbalances can have a huge impact on our TDEE
💥 Chronic Inflammation - due to a number of different things: stress, illness,  poor diet etc
💥 Lack of sleep - Sleep is as important for weight loss as exercise and nutrition - look up the scientific literature
.
.
This does NOT mean calories don't matter. They do. But they're not the only things that matter. This post is to inform you that your body is complex. Much more complex than we think. That's why as a nutritionist my LAST question is actually about nutrition and food. I get a full insight into people's whole lives. It's not always as simple as a calculation unfortunately.

In Fact if anything I think you're a little more courageous

You are not expected to know everything. That's why people have occupations with the relevant knowledge and skills to help 👌
.
.
💥 If you are a student, unsure of your path. Please talk to a career guidance teacher.
💥 If you are unsure of your career and thinking about changing everything for a different route. Maybe you could see a life coach.
💥 If you are sick. See a doctor.
💥 If you are having mental health issues, a counsellor may be an option
💥 If you're having car troubles, go to a mechanic.
💥 If your phone isn't working, bring it to a phone shop.

See the trend???

Once upon a time I thought I was totally independent. I didn't want to ask for help from anyone!!! But then I realised, I can't do it all alone and actually support and guidance is the best thing I could get. NOW, I ask for help all the time. From family, friends, and colleagues. I have a coach. If my mental health is affecting me I call someone for help. One of the best things I ever did was see a life coach ❤

Why is it so hard for people to see the same applies to training and nutrition? 🥴🥴🥴 You could be spending weeks, months or even years trying to do it alone? 🙈 Wasting your time and money in the process. If you aren't qualified in the area. YOU CAN ALWAYS ASK FOR HELP 🙏 Please please stop making poor nutrition choices based on what Google told you. Stop wasting time trying to 'shred belly fat' based on a free workout Susan gave you.

Ask for help. Stop wasting your time. I'm literally just a phone call away.

A few new followers since I moved abroad so here's 10 Things you may not know about me 🤪
.
.
1. I was born in Donegal (all you will know me as a Rossie but I've been a true Donegal wannabe my whole life 💚💛) I did well to find a Donegal man too 😆
.
2. I'm actually a dab hand at Karaoke. Some of you will know me from 'My Happy Ending' days and my most recent power ballad is D.I.V.O.R.C.E. @o_boyce doesn't allow me to sing it anymore as I once cleared a bar out in Albuferia.
.
3. I have one sister @lauramcloone. She is my best friend 🥰
.
4. I have played football my whole life. I was useless when I was younger. Persistance and my singing skills paid off when I was asked to play with Roscommon intermediate Ladies back in 2009. I had 10 years played with Roscommon and 2 Connacht interpro jerseys under my belt before I announced my retirement last year.
.
5. Andy Moran overshadowed my retirement in 2019. (No harsh feelings Andy)
.
6. I can't drink for shite. I continue to try though 💪
.
7. I have the same amount of medals from Scaled Crossfit comps last year as I have for playing with Roscommon 🙈 (still the best days of my life but I want younger people to see it's not all about winning)
.
8. I ruptured my ACL, broke my wrist in 2 places and badly dislocated my finger all within 15 months. Previous to that, I never had an injury.
.
9. My Dad died of Pancreatic Cancer in 2015. Since then, I have been an advocate for health and happiness. I do everything in my power to be the healthiest version of myself. I also like to do fundraisers and my most recent one raised over $10,000 aud for May Roscommon Hospice.
.
10. I've only been in the fitness industry 6 years but I honestly feel like it's my whole life. It's not just a job, but a passion and I adore it 💖",259,4,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/117110826_1263609803974978_2259090729047193213_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=O5XxWz4qasIAX8M5H_l&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfAc4v5xGTNm5rMvdAYllElWykmdf48ecMQDdRTGY4Zonw&oe=63D8E872,https://www.instagram.com/p/CDZw85YBvxW/,17875085326785434,,"[{'timestamp': '2020-08-02T22:01:41+0000', 'text': 'I did not expect karaoke to be mentioned', 'username': 'jordanst3wart', 'like_count': 2, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2020-08-02T22:03:36+0000', 'text': ""@jordanst3wart you'll never get to experience it with Owen there!!! 😂"", 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '17848912982227344'}]}, 'id': '17866259737900565'}, {'timestamp': '2020-08-02T21:58:49+0000', 'text': ""LOVELY! 🔥We are open for collab.

What are yours?
 
- Karen wants to be super lean <20% BF. But Karen enjoys socialising at the weekend and religiously has a takeaway to cure herself Sunday. Karen doesn't want to put in the commitment to get to her goal. And that's ok, because it's not 'easy' to get visible abs. It requires sacrifice. It requires hard work. And not everyone is willing to do that. 

- John wants to become a 6 figure coach. John works 9-5 Monday to Friday. John trains himself twice a day. John competes in bodybuilding competitions (he's in GREAT SHAPE). But he won't sacrifice his training for his client's timetables. John is not making sacrifices. John is unlikely to become a 6 figure coach with his current attitude.

When I played football....

I lived, slept and breathed football.

My whole life revolved around football - social occassions, relationships, friendships, family events, work. I honestly mean MY WHOLE LIFE. Some would have called me obsessed. But I truely believe this is the level you need to prioritise Inter County football. I was never the best player in the world but find someone who worked harder than me, not just on the pitch but in every element of my life. I am an athlete. I still consider myself an athlete but my priorities have definitely shifted. 

Instead of Sunday morning matches, I have swapped it for Sunday morning breakfast. Instead of Friday night training, I'm enjoying Friday morning training in the gym. Instead of a very lean physique, it's obvious I train but enjoy chocolate too ;) 

Priorities change and that's ok. 

If you are someone who's willing to put in minimal effort but expecting huge results, it's not going to happen (unless you are genetically gifted). If you are someone that enjoys socialising every weekend, you're probably not going to make an Inter county team.

A healthy lifestyle is relatively simple. It is we who over complicate it. That doesn't mean it's easy. Easy and simple are very different words. There are many barriers in our way of health, some we have no control over like socio economic status, but there are many we can control 🙏 So let's try and control the controllables..

👉 Stressing over small things (I'm getting better but not perfect)
👉 Over working (I love my job but that doesn't mean every waking minute should revolve around it)
👉 Over training 
👉 Being on my phone too much (part of it is due to work but I need to get away from this one)

Weekends are my 'rest' and 'reset' time. For so long I was in 'constant go go go mode'. At home I worked Monday to Friday (long days), Saturday was study and Sunday was football. I NEVER switched off, unless I took a holiday. I'm never going to be a laze in bed until 11 on a Saturday morning kinda gal 😅 But it's nice to know sometimes I can just sit and be present with my coffee and a good breakfast at weekends 🥰

.
.
When I was younger I wanted to be a teacher...
.
After work experience, I knew I didn't have the patience to be a primary or secondary school teacher. But turns out I still went down that path.📚
.
.
My education and teachings don't have a syllabus. They are constantly changing. There is no one size fits all approach.
.
.
I love this though. I love helping others. I love practicising what I preach. This is not just my job. This is my passion and lifestyle 🥰
.
.
What better way to spend a Saturday morning than with like minded people. Training. Drinking coffee. And talking sense 👊 @strengthandmovementlab so happy to be part of this great community 😊😊😊

6,2020-07-16T04:46:45+0000,"It would be so hard to be a teenager right now 🤦‍♀️🙈
.
.
I thought my teenage years were tough. I can definitely say it was the peak of my self loathing. I hated my body. I drank too much. I self harmed. I worked too hard. I put too much pressure on myself.
.
.
And I didn't have social media or drugs in that era 🥺😞
.
.
1. Social Media
The ideal of perfection is damaging. The 'perfect body'. The 'perfect make up'. The 'perfect picture'. The 'perfect life'. It's ALL FAKE NEWS!!!!!! Please please please stop following people who make you feel inferior. Stop trying to look like influencers. Stop trying to seek a perfection that doesn't exsist 🚫🚫🚫
.
.
2. Drugs
Since when are drugs the norm? 🤷‍♀️ Yes I am going to address the elephant in the room 🐘 I actually cannot get my head around this... It's like teenagers are now fully grown adults 😔 Making choices like this probably won't affect you now. But NO ONE IS THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE!!! 😟 
.
.
I feel like I am old (maybe not wise) beyond my years. Everyone is looking for the quick fix. The easy option. The momentary high. No one is thinking about the long term. Their health? Long term health 😶 Physical and Mental Health 😞😣
.
.
Can we please protect this group of young adults? Can we please do our best to be good role models? Can we show them that perfection DOESN'T exsist? Can we encourage them to act their age and stop trying to be and look like adults?

Super Simple, Nutritious and delicious

Ingredients (makes 3-4 portions)
500g Chikcen 
Green and Red Pepper
Onion 
Tomato Paste
Chilli Powder 
Garlic Powder
Salt
Pepper
Tbsp Olive oil
.
.
Optional:
Low Fat Cheese
Wraps
.
.
Fry peppers,onions and chicken in Olive oil until golden brown. Add 5 tbsp tomato paste, garlic, chilli, salt and pepper and simmer for 10 mins
.
.
I have about 2600 calories to play about with so I added low fat cheese to a whole grain wrap. If weight loss is a goal why not add the mixture to a low calorie wrap alternative or a lettuce boat?

I can't claim it as my own. One of my clients came up with the flavours 🤤 She  used zuchinni (courgette😅) but I prefer spinach.
.
.
Super Simple. I use it as a snack. You can use as breakfast, lunch or dinner 🥰
.
.
Steps:
1. Grease if not greaseproof (mindful of calories)
2. Shred spinach in bottom of bun tin. 
3. Pour egg in on top
4. Add 1 cube feta (be mindful of calories)
5. Cook at 180 degrees for 25 -30 mins

12,2020-07-07T20:32:44+0000,"SMART GOALS 🚀🚀🚀
.
.
DO YOU REALLY NEED THEM? Well if you're looking to make progress, yes!!!
.
.
How long have you been wanting to get a pull up for? How long have you wanted to lose that extra kg? How long have you wanted to improve your speed? 
.
.
Well then you need to make smart goals. You also need to take action  in the steps to achieving these goals. What are SMART GOALS?
.
.
S - Specific - Weight loss is too general. You need a specific target in mind and a path to get you to that goal.
.
M - Mesurable - 60m dash speed is measurable - 'getting faster' Isn't 
.
A - Achievable - this one is a BIG one. Please don't set yourself up for failure. If you have just started resistance training and you want to compete in a bikini competitions in 8 weeks with no coach you are setting yourself up for a fail 🙈
.
R - Realistic - If you are playing high level football and want to sign up for a Crossfit competition just don't 😅 (unless you are me. I know Pot Kettle Black - I still wouldn't advise it)
.
T - Time Specific - Instead of 'I want to be able to do 10 Chin ups (btw this is a very hard goal) - why not say ' I want to be able to do 1 chin up in 8 weeks and maybe 5 Chin ups in 6 months'
.
.
Now you have your goals decided make a plan to make it to your destination. If your goal is to master chin ups and your constantly doing hiit classes (unless the classes have this in it) you're probably never going to achieve that goal. If your goal is weight loss but you're not interested in changing your diet, you're probably never going to achieve that goal. Be SMART about your planning too 🙃 
.
.
Some of my goals to share with you:
💫 I want to be able to do All Rx exercises by the end of 2020
💫 I want top 100 in Ireland in 2021 Open
💫 I want a 50kg Snatch by September 
💫 I want an 80kg C&J by the end of 2020",76,4,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/106584110_202018334476784_411814692654065723_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=qhvU1IPnLxQAX8p5Xdp&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfCp52D4adAVX8Yd0eY34YXW6rqOSNBjbomFH-UgDOfgPg&oe=63D772E2,https://www.instagram.com/p/CCWrn4phuje/,17907147211475990,,"[{'timestamp': '2020-07-13T10:45:10+0000', 'text': 'Yahhhh girl!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽', 'username': 'danielle_stone', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '18125457604107995'}, {'timestamp': '2020-07-07T21:58:39+0000', 'text': 'Wow now that’s form👏👏👏', 'username': 'kjheery', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2020-07-07T22:05:30+0000', 'text': '@kjheery ah Thanks Kevin.

I truely believe people think. Ah ya, she's always been fit it's easy for her. Sure what would I know I've never had to lose weight 🤷‍♀️
.
.
Not every battle can be seen 🚫🚫🚫
.
.
I struggled with my image from a young age. People will think I was always confident, always the life and soul of the party. But it wasn't until I seen a counsellor that I realised I was masking my unhappiness. I had issues I didn't even know exsisted. When I was in school I was so self conscious. I had mental health problems I didn't know exsisted. These continued on into my early 20s. I was obsessed with my body image. EVERY single time I walked past a mirror I checked for abs. I took photos of myself every single day on the quest for a 6 pack 😔 My relationship with food and exercise was poor 😰 I honestly thought I was not lean in the first photo 😬
.
.
Fast forward to being 29 🥰 I cannot believe the journey I've been on to get here but I am in love with the process 🤩 I am so proud of what my body can do. I fuel it right. I'm good to it (most of the time, unless I do too much 🤪😶). It's not all about the physical. Physically I'm probably the fittest I've ever been but MENTALLY I'm 100% the best I've ever been 💘 
.
.
So please don't think I don't know what it's like. That because my journey is not weight loss, that it doesn't matter or count. EVERY journey to better health matters. EVERY conscious effort to improve mental and physical health matters.

If I could give my top pieces of advice, they would be:
.
1. Base your diet on one ingredient foods - Meat, Fruit, Vegetables, Nuts, Eggs, Grains etc. 
.
2. Get 2L of water in daily
.
3. Sleep 7-9 hours a night
.
4. Get 10,000 Steps in daily 
.
5. Eat protein with each meal
.
6. Self care daily - whatever it is that destresses you, do it

7. Resistance train 3 times a week

As per usual, this is very individual based but I'll try make this advice as generic as possible 😊
.
.
1. Don't expect to lift what you lifted pre Covid (unless you've had a home gym setting and have been training consistently during isolation)
2. Ease yourself in. 3 days of training will be MORE than enough. You WILL be sore. You don't need to make up for lost time. You don't need to punish yourself for the extra half stone you gained. Just ease yourself back in.
3. Get back into a routine. Sleep, hydration and training. Make these a priority.
4. Recovery is KEY!!!!! Nutrition will be more important than ever. Protein is our principal recovery food. Eat it in abundance. Carbs are our main energy source. Don't neglect them. Essentials fats have anti inflammatory properties. Eat them 🥑 And let's make sure our immune system is in tip top shape. Keep lots of colour and fibre in there too 🍆🍎🍌🥒🍄
.
.
It's pretty simple really
.
.
If you want to avoid monstrous doms and increasing risk of injury. Take this advice.
.

If not, enjoy sitting on the toilet seat 🚽🚽🚽

.

Contrary to popular belief not everyone trains to have abs 🤫
.
.
🙋‍♀️I used to. And I didn't enjoy my training. Actually scrap that I didn't enjoy life 🤐🤨 I ate so clean, I did not have 'cheat food' and I was tired and moody constantly. Since then, I've learned to love my training and what my body is capable of 🥰🤭 I also like to socialise 🐷🥂 .
.
For me, happiness is not linked to a body part or looking a certain way. It's being confident in your body. Eating to nourish and fuel your body. Training to be fitter and stronger not to look like a fitness model. .
.
So no, I don't have visible abs. Not constantly anyway. And I don't care.

.
.
Firstly, I actually don't like posts like this. I feel people think if they eat it, they will look or perform like the person who's diet it is. And that's not necessarily the case.
.
.
What I'm trying to do is educate you and make you understand that you CAN and SHOULD eat lots of nutritious food ☺ And there can also be some room for the odd treat 😉 You don't need to have that: Restrict/Binge cycle that so many of you subject yourselves to 😭 As I've mentioned before I don't count calories. But I'm Fairly in tune with my body and know what my body needs.
.
.
I eat lots of protein (varying my sources - Whey Protein, Greek Yogurt Salmon, Chicken), change my veggie cooking methods (raw and Stirfried), I eat fresh and frozen fruit and have good fats in there too (feta cheese and nuts). .
.
My nutrition is based on my weight, activity level and training. Please don't eat these exact foods, thinking they are 'the best' foods to eat 🤦‍♀️ Instead educate yourself. Maybe even invest in someone who specialises in the area 😁 .

I 'prescribed' a client to eat more fruit during the week. And she questioned the idea 'does too much fruit not store as fat?'. Too much anything will result in excess calories which will result in weight gain. Too much Fruit will not solely 'turn to fat'. .
.
The difficult thing with nutrition and understanding nutrition is there is so much crap on the internet. And then even the science changes regularly so it really is a minefield 🤯🤯🤯
.
.
This guide is great to show that you can get a lot more bang for your buck with fruits like berries and watermelon. More quantity leaves a greater satiety which avoids over eating. As opposed to a simple banana that is convenient.
.
.
I have had people over consume fruit. It's not totally false. And if you are bodybuilding or prepping fpr something that requires a very low body fat, you may need to be careful with fruit. Fruits are simple sugars and are classified as carbohydrates. But they are full of vitamins, minerals, water and fibre.

.
.
As most of you already know I was allergic to core work 😅 I did it through my strength training and that was it. I have no desire to have a 6 pack so it just seemed irrelevant to do isolation exercises 😅🙈
.
.
Since starting my Crossfit Programme my core strength has been seriously tested. I thought (and still believe) I don't have a weak core. But there are so many levels our core strength can get to. Gymnastics is a new ball game to me and my God has my core has been tested 🤪😬 I'm now very happy I've been doing this extra core work because it's helped a lot.
.
.
1. Toes to Bar
2. L Sit
3. Hollow Rocks
4. Half Get Up
5. Palloff Press with Squat
6. Side Plank rotations
.

These are just some of the exercises I'm doing regularly. Again, they are a little more advanced. And don't expect miracles when it comes to training your core. I'm not promising a six pack but I certainly believe I'm getting stronger doing it 💪

Did you spend the last 3 months doing anything productive? Did you procrastinate? Did you work towards your goals?

I decided I wanted to work harder on Crossfit. Having never giving it my full attention I decided what better time to start into a Crossfit programme than during isolation. Sure I had no access to a lot of equipment but that doesn't mean I wanted to sit about doing nothing. That wasnt going to get me to where I wanted to be. I started isolation with a KB, a skipping rope and attempted some met cons. I hadn't been following a programme since before December. 6 weeks ago I got on board with @estevolveprogramming and i haven't looked back 😍🤩 I'm still not where i want to be BUT I'm a hell of a lot closer than I was 🙌🙌🙌 My 2020 goals:
👉 By the end of 2020 I want to be able to do everything rx
👉 I want to improve my Open position
.

The time is going to pass. Why don't you stop talking about it and take action? Why not stop starting over and stick with something consistently. Its 6 months into the year. Prioritise your health. Prioritise you!!!! #endofisolationinaustrailia

Health is my goal. I don't track calories. I train hard and I'm pretty good at guestimating what I need to fuel me 🙌 So therefore this breakfast is perfect for me.

It's fantastic to see football is back on the cards for 2020 😍🤩 But don't forget or lose sight of what a crazy year it has been. .

👉 Your body has not been training as normal (NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF TRAINING YOU'VE BEEN DOING)
👉 Do not overload your body as you increase your risk of injury.
👉 Nutrition is so overlooked. It will be your best friend during this period. High Protein, complex carbs, good fats and lots of micronutrients (fruit and veggies)
👉 At least 2L water daily.
👉 Fix your sleep routine which is probably all out of whack 😵

12,2020-06-02T21:36:16+0000,"Hi Guys,

So with the month of June being @lauramcloone birth month and the month Ireland celebrates Father's Day I thought it'd be a great month to do a fundraiser 🙌

As most of you already know, Laura and I lost our dad Denis to pancreatic cancer in 2015. This will be our 5th Father's day and Laura's birthday without him 💔 During the time leading up to his untimely death, the Mayo Roscommon Hospice and Palliative Care were incredible so we have decided to donate all proceeds to this amazing cause 🤩

What are we doing: 🏋️‍♀️Laura and I plan on lifting 200 tonnes over the month of June between us 🤪 Yes you heard right - 200,000kg!!!
To give you an idea of what this looks like - 40 x 80kg Deadlifts daily for the month of June. Sound manageable?

Anyone who knows me, knows I never really bothered with core isolation. I much rather do some Olympic lifting 😜😂 But the last 3 weeks I have been put to the test 🙊🙈

Some of these are quite advanced but if you're looking for advancing your core work why not give them a try 🙌

1. Copenhagen Windmill Side Bridge
2. Hollow Hold
3. Straddle Arrested Superman
4. Candlestick levers
5. Sit Up with press

I presume people know this already but just to clarify... Doing isolation ab work, will NOT give you visible abs if you have a layer of fat over your abs ❌❌❌ You need to improve your nutrition and shed fat through a calorie deficit to have visible abs 😭😭😭

It honestly was one of the nicest things to hear ❤️ I have always been an open book. I never say life is perfect when it's not. Life is far from perfect but I try to see the best in all situations 🙏

.
Once upon a time I didn't look after myself. I looked after everyone and everything else. I gave everything to helping my family, working and playing football. I had nothing left for me 🤷‍♀️

I made the decision last year to come to Australia for me and Owen. So for once, we came first ❤️🙏So many years of putting everything else first very nearly burnt me out 😳But we're here. Living our best lives ❤️🙌

.
Honestly, I can say that getting a coach (Alan you know who you are) and seeing a counsellor were the best things I have ever done in my entire life. They changed my outlook on life. They made me focus on myself and looking after no. 1. They helped me deal with my constant need to help everyone. And they helped me overcome a lot of anxiety and stress related problems I've had ❤️

Is your coach programming to your lifestyle or are you changing your lifestyle to suit the programme? 🤔

.
I feel that people think I only coach athletes 🤦‍♀️ Or that I will make you do what I do 😩 Honestly, I've only had 1 Client I have progressed to a really high level. And she has been with me for over a year 🤣 Most of my clients are: Hot mommas trying to get back into fitness, lovely ladies trying to get into a routine, teenage girls who want to start strength & conditioning and women just wanting to build better relationships with themselves and food 🙌🙌🙌
.
.
A handful of my clients have done some of the training I do. Most of them start as beginners or intermediate ✔️✔️✔️
.
.
There is honestly nothing to worry about when training with me. I progress and regress all my programmes based on the individual. I work my programmes around the client, not the client around the programme 🚫🚫🚫 I love coaching. Coaching is about the clients, not me. I provide the tools, they do the work ❤️🙌

These are just some of the questions I am asked on a regular basis 🙈 The list really does go on.....
.
.
Please realise, like food there is NO one size fits all. Everybody is different. Has different goals. Has different commitments. Has different preferences. Everyone is at different fitness levels
🚫🚫🚫
.
.
My answer is normally: Do 70% of the exercise you like and 30% of the exercise you need. How often can you commit to exercise? I wouldn't be telling a 6 Week post partum mother to exercise for 90 Mins everyday at 5pm because that is just unrealistic. There is no specific time or regularity you need to follow. But you do need to find something that suits you and your schedule. Just because Susan doesn't consider walking exercise doesn't mean you can't 🤦‍♀️
.
.
Stop comparing yourself to people on instagram 🤦‍♀️ Stop feeling 'guilty' that you're not exercising twice a day 🚫 Stop thinking if you do what you're favorite influencer is doing, you'll look like her ❌
.
.
Do what you can ✔️
Do it to the best of YOUR ability ✅
Enjoy it ❤️ #fitness #fitlifestyle #stoplisteningtocelebrities #stopcomparing

Think about that one 🙈🤔 Are you doing the same thing everyday and expecting a different result 🙄😱
.
.
This can relate to all areas of your life 💥💥💥 Be it in a relationship? Or a job? But it most certainly can be used when it comes to health and fitness 🙈
.
.
A little information about me:
👆 I am HIGHLY self motivated. I work outrageously hard at what I do in all areas of my life. Not everyone is. That's fine (And also where investing in a coach is a very good idea). 👆 I am really positive. Not always but I try to keep a good outlook on life. I have not had an easy ride. I have probably been through more in a couple of years than most go through in their lifetime. But I don't let it define me and I don't whinge and complain about it (all the time anyway 🙈).
👆 I know what I'm good at but I also know where my weak points are. I'm constantly learning and I believe that we can all benefit from other knowledge and expertise.
👆 I belive in giving compliments. People should know what a good job they are doing. Jealousy is natural but is usually a reflection of you and not the person or thing you are jealous of. Jealousy can actually have a postive effect on us if treated right, it can motivate us to get to where we WANT to be 🙌
.
.
Long winded point of this post. Are you doing what you need to do, to get where you want to be?
💥For me, I'm working when other people are drinking. I'm awake when others are asleep. I'm training in the rain when other people are making excuses. 💥
.
.
I don't wait for things to happen. I MAKE THEM HAPPEN 🎉🎉🎉 What do you do? 🤔

Testimonial:
I decided to do Amanda’s programme because with everything that’s gone on in the world, my routine had gone totally out the window and I was anxious and had a feeling that I wasn’t in control over my eating habits/excercise regime. I knew I needed support to help me get out of that comfort eating/constant snacking. Amanda offered great support and guidance and empowered me to put a proper structure in place for my food/excercise. I looked forward to our phone calls and check-ins. Even if I was feeling slightly guilty before our conversation about certain food choices etc, talking to Amanda totally reassured me and she managed to always make me leave the conversation feeling good about myself. Her knowledge of food and nutrition is second to none and her enthusiasm for all things fitness is infectious. I feel more confident and I look forward to continue working with Amanda in the future and would recommend her to anyone looking to make a change.
.

This lady was delighted with her results and not just physically. But her confidence has gone through the roof 🙌 Healthier and happier 🌼🌼🌼 P. S She was able to celebrate her sister's birthday with cake and ate it 🍰🍰🍰

Finally, talking about why you shouldn't copy 'What your favourite influencer eats in a day'. There are many factors that affect calorie intake. You should not be copying what other people eat and expect to look/perform like them 🙄 Here is what you need to know.

When I was growing up. I had role models. They were usually female Footballers. @valeriemulcahy @emercaseyross were 2 big ones for me. They excelled in their sport and showed a level of professionalism and work ethic I had never seen before 🙌💯 .
.
These days though there are female role models everywhere 😍 There are women in relationships earning more than their male partners. There are women bossing the business industry. There are strong women. Female Gaa players these days are considered celebrities. Women commentators on sports shows. Body confident women. The list is ENDLESS 🙌🙌🙌
.
.
The word role model has been thrown at me a few times. And honestly, I turn into a shy kid when it does. It is genuinely one of the greatest compliments I've ever gotten. Why? Because I know what it means ❤️
.
.
What do I try to bring to the table:
💥My work ethic - in everything I do. Hard work gets you places. It may be the extra hours work I put in to build a future business. It may be the extra work I put in off the field. It may be the hour earlier I get up to get my steps in. These extras will all add up some day.
""Hard Work beats talent, when talent doesn't work hard"" ❤️
.
💥I try to portray a stong, resilient personality - Life is not always easy, but you have a choice in how you react.
.
💥My relationship with food and exercise - I love exercise. I love what my body can do and how strong I've become. I love being able to lift the same weights as @o_boyce 😜 But I love to show women it is important to nourish your body. I love educating people 🙌
.
💥Body confidence - This is not a size or a weight on a scales. This is not something gained overnight and it can take ALOT of work.
.
.
My Advice:
Stop looking at celebrities and their bodies and start looking at Real women. Real women with their cellulite and their imperfect skin. Real women who work 40 hours a week. Real women who have families and have dinner on the table every evening. .

.
.
You know what I'm talking about here. That person who constantly has 'tight hamstrings'. Or the full forward who repeatedly strains their calves. What about the goalie with the shoulder impingement?  Or the corner back who has tore their quad on more than one occasion 🙈
.
.
I've had my fair share of serious injuries. I've had my ACL reconstructed. Broke the 2 bones in my wrist and had wires inserted. Dislocated fingers badly 🙈I Attribute it to the fact that I put my body on the line and never pulled out of a tackle. My years and years of running the pitch ragged caught up on me when I developed tendonopathy in my Achilles but I've never had a muscular injury 🤔🤔🤔
.
.
Why? Especially after ACL reconstruction. People normally have issues. Why didn't I?
💥Firstly, I am not a physio or a doctor. What I'm about to say is my opinion💥
.
🌟 Consistency - This is a major problem in the world of GAA. Players spend a month or 2 in pre season and that's their gym work for the year done ❌❌❌ Strength based training should be done year long for athletes. A good coach will periodise it and tailor it to the individual and their workload. But it should not be neglected mid season
.
. 🌟Knowledge - It's not enough to be doing a few Squats and Pull ups. If you are 'doing your own thing' or 'copying other people' it won't suffice. Pitch athletes require good exercise prescription, relevant to them and their sport. Basic, generic plans could lead to injury.
.
.
🌟Nutrition - High protein diet with carbohydrates for fuel, good fats for recovery and micro nutrients for immune function. Again, not just in season but off season too. Please do not under estimate the importance of good nutrition year round ❤️🙌
.
.
I was lucky enough to have a solid career on the pitch. Even when I had serious injuries I bounced back from them. I wasn't the player constantly on the side line with recurring injuries 🙋‍♀️And that wasn't down to luck. That was down to looking after myself.

1. Fill up your plate with nutrient dense, low calorie vegetables.
2. Add a decent protein source - opt for oily fish regularly 3-4 times a week. White meat/fish is lower calorie if weight loss is the goal. 
3. You don't need to eliminate carbohydrates. Our body wants them. Our brain needs them. Just reduce your portion size and choose the right type of carbs.
4. P. S Fats are also vitally important but I've used this as a typical 'Irish dinner' (meat, veg and spuds type🇮🇪) .

Rather than using the term 'rabbit food' 🐰
.
.
💥5 Steps to a tasty, nutritious Salad💥
. 
1. Choose your base - I usually go spinach, you could go iceberg lettuce, kale, whatever you fancy
.
.
2. Add in some extra colour - I usually go beetroot, maybe carrot or peppers - I know tomatoes are a staple or maybe you'd like to add some olives 🍸
.
.
3. Add in some fats and/or Carbs - I tend to add a cheese - Feta, Goats, Halloumi. I sometimes add carbs to my salads but I rather fats. You could add cous cous or quinoa.
.
.
4. Add dressing - this is my go to. Low cál and the tastiest there is. The odd time I might use pesto but I never waste my calories on dressings 🐷
.
.
5. Add a protein and I like to add some fruit to colour ❤️💜💙 I tend to be a salmon, chicken or turkey burger gal 🙋‍♀️
.
.
Don't think for a single second just because you eat salads you'll lose weight 🙄 Salads have the potential to have higher calories than you think. Overdoing it on fat based foods like cheese or nuts or calorie laden dressings are the 2 main culprits 😏 There's also the fact that because they don't 'fill you' you may over eat after it 😕

🙈🙈🙈
.
.
Real Time. My 3 main meals are full of nutrients, wholesome and enjoyable food. But the last 3 weeks I cannot stop snacking because of working from home. Sound familiar? 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️ I have fallen into this vicious trap. But this week, I'm taking action. Who's with me?
.
.
How do I plan on doing it?

1. Plan my meals and snacks. Knowing exactly what I plan on having for each meal or snack and not going 'outside the plan'.
.
2. Protein rich snacks - to keep you fuller for longer. I always recommend this to clients but recently have not been practicing what I preach.

3. Fruit is still a great snack 🙋‍♀️
.
4. Make sure I'm not just bored or thirsty. If I feel I want to go for a snack, I'll drink some water and re assess in 30 Mins. If you're still hungry. Pick up your snack from your meal plan.

5. Find a structure that works for you. I allow clients have treats. People need rewards. ❤️ I however, need to stop rewarding myself so much 😂 I always called treats and irregular thing. But they've become too regular and now can't be called a treat 🙈 So I'm pulling back on that too 👌

Lastly guys, if you are mindlessly snacking and don't care, that's fine. We are in such a crazy time, it might seem like the least of your priorities right now for you. My priority is to get into a structure and routine so I need to do this 🤷‍♀️

Amanda, thank you for everything over the last 6 weeks.
I have gained so much knowledge.
Amanda gave me 3 different styles of food plans and I have found this great as I found one of these great for me and something that I can definitely use long-term and is something that is now becoming my normal. I am so much more conscious of what I am putting into my body.
Previously I have dieted and went on food plans that were unrealistic long-term and I was always hungry but with Amanda’s I’m enjoying the food. A major shock for me was that I was actually eating more throughout the day than I had been but eating more nutritiously and therefore I never felt hungry.

Before starting Amanda’s programme I did zero exercise. I was always active with work and never felt the need to. But following an injury 2 years ago my activity levels changed and I was for the most part inactive.
I had previously tried going to the gym myself but that only lasted 2 weeks and I lost motivation and felt very self conscious. 
Amanda has been brilliant at motivating me to do more. Encouraging  me and reassuring me that it doesn’t need to be perfect as long as I’m trying and pushing.
As someone that is very self-conscious in a gym it was brilliant when Amanda gave the option of home workouts too. I found these brilliant and I can do them anytime.
I can definitely see me sticking to these and I’m really enjoying doing them. I have done one Zoom session with Amanda too and it was great, felt such a buzz after. Looking forward to doing more.

Amanda was always there if you had any questions. I loved the accountability side of things, this was a major motivator for me.

I didn’t lose any weight on the scales or any inches, however my body shape has definitely changed for the better. Only for Amanda getting me to take photos I wouldn’t have seen this progress. Going forward that’s what I will be going on and will not be focusing on the scales, it was getting me so down and I think maybe that’s a factor in why previously I’ve lost motivation.",98,1,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/94376906_1638058983029737_5510974254441630629_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=xSPnKh8CQygAX_AwiW8&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfDZWaUlBGamUziuBD_0kS9KapW77cbYU0ECCGCZncZAYQ&oe=63D84E45,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_PZc7RB88v/,18137778130029813,,"[{'timestamp': '2020-04-21T11:05:57+0000', 'text': '#onlineclient #progress #realnutrition #realresults', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '17890605970510645'}]",,

.
.
🙋‍♀️Firstly, I know this may seem ridiculous to some of you but not everyone out there has to gain weight and do a 'mini cut' after enjoying their holidays too much 🙈 Like it's absolutely OK if you do, but it's also OK if you DON'T 😘 Your body shape doesn't HAVE to change regularly. You can boringly stay the same, all the time 😂🙋‍♀️
.
.
☢️Secondly, up until the last few months I didn't have cellulite. There I said it 😣🙈 I nearly felt guilty that I didn't have it😲 It's 100% normal to have it, so it's FINE if you do, but it's also equally fine if you don't 🤦‍♀️ (p.s the reason I now have it is because I drink more regularly and enjoy a lot more treats. That's absolutely fine. I'm OK with my cellulite but it didn't just miraculously appear. It is as a result of lifestyle choices)
.
.
🦄I absolutely LOVE that body confidence has become such an amazing thing now ❤️I am the biggest advocate of self love. But sometimes comments can be geared negatively towards fit people🤔 I for one Have Never Ever dieted dramatically. I've actually gained weight, muscle to be precise, almost 2.5 stone of it (well maybe a little fat 😉😂) I still fit into the same clothes, consistently over the last few years (I need new clothes🤔) . I train regularly. I nourish my body. And that's OK. Whatever way keeps you HEALTHY that is the main thing. 😀 There is no one size fits all 👍

.
.
A complex is any series of movements performed back-to-back with the same piece of equipment in which the set number of reps is completed for each movement before moving on to the next. It is also nice to create a flow for the exercises. You can do this with a Barbell, Kettlebell, Dumbells, a Sandbag or a Deadball. It is a another great way to increase difficulty of exercises with limited equipment during quarantine. 🙌
.
.
My Complex This morning was 20 sets of:
- 1 Deadlift
- 1 Hang Clean
- 1 Split Jerk
(The ideal weight should be determined by the most difficult exercise. So for example this deadlift was relatively easy for me but the split Jerk was harder.)
.
.
An idea of a double DB Complex Could be:
- 10 Renegade Row
- 10 RDL
- 10 Cleans
- 10 Front Squat
- 10 Push Press
.
.
These are a great way to get more bang for your buck with very little equipment 🙌

This means single arm, single leg movements. Ever noticed in a Bench Press  one arm is more dominant than the other?🤔 Or do you play sport and notice that balance is better on one leg over the other 🤔 Unilateral movements should be in all good programme design. They should be implemented to help improve weaknesses and imbalances. 👌 They are also a great method of varying difficulty of home based training at the moment 💪
👉 A basic air squat vs a pistol squat 😯
👉 BW Glute bridges vs SL elevated bridges 🍑 👉 Push ups vs single arm push ups 😂

Unilateral Movement is an important accessorie tool for all strength based training. If you haven't started implementing it, start now 💪

👉Then we were told to fast...
.
.
So what's the deal? Is breakfast really the most important meal of the day? 🤔
.
.
So I'm not going talk from a scientific perspective right now. Even though a lot of the science that is thrown around this topic is all horse crap anyway 🙈 From a personal perspective.
.
.
👉 If you absolutely detest eating a breakfast. I say don't eat a breakfast. I'm not going to force feed someone a breakfast 'so they don't go into starvation mode' 🙈. But if they're general wake up call is a cigarette and a coffee, I'd recommend something a little more substantial of course. But forcing and scare mongoring is not something I recommend.
👉On the opposite scale of things, fasting is not for everyone. It is not some miracle weight loss programme. It is simply, consuming fewer calories in a smaller space of time. It works for some people it doesn't for others. I personally like to push my breakfast out to 9 or 10am because my days are long. If I start eating when I get up, I'd eat too much calories, simply because I'm eating too many times 😂
.
.
We over complicate everything 🙈😂 Please don't listen to celebrities or unqualified people about these topics🤔
.
.
It's (for the most part - not all cases I.e someone who's diabetic etc) this simple. If you want to eat breakfast eat it. If you don't, don't.
💥Fasted cardio is useless unless you are in a calorie deficit.
💥Your body will not 'eat itself' if you skip breakfast.

👉Weight loss/maintenance - Loading your plate with low calorie foods will help reduce your overall calorie intake
👉 Health - Loading your plate with nutrient dense food is one simple way to boost immunity
👉 Improve Satiety (avoiding overeating due to boredom) - Loading your plate with vegetables and having a filling lunch and dinner will help avoid 'picking' 🙈
👉 Performance - Loading your plate with vegetables will help with energy levels (not necessarily a fuel source) but as a result of more vitamins and minerals in the diet.

💥Having a job I love - I miss working full time so much 😢 thank God I have my online clients ❤️ 💥How fortunate I am to be over here, to have travelled, to have enough money to survive something like this, to have food and a roof over my head ❤️
💥My health - another one I don't think I take for granted but appreciate it now more than ever.
💥My strength (if I lose it all during this crisis I vow to come back again stronger than ever💪) God I miss the gym so much 😭 This is honestly the longest I've been away from it for years. The gym is my safety net,it's actually helped me so much over the years so not having it is really hard 😢 But it'll be all worth it when we've all pulled together to fight this 💪💪💪

.
.
This is not something I discuss regularly because this is normally an advance on normal gym training. I tend to keep things simple for people because people over complicate everything 🙄 Basics first always 😂
.
.
But as most people are probably struggling with equipment this may be a handy tool 👌
.
.
TUT or Tempo refers to how long or how much time a muscle is under strain. The longer time your muscle is under stress the greater muscle fiber recruitment it will have. You will usually load the muscle in the eccentric phase (downward portion of the exercise). So as you are lowering yourself in a Squat or lowering yourself down from a pull up. In the videos, I am slowly controlling my movements. The weight is light but because I am using TUT and adding more reps I am getting more bang for my buck 💶💶💶

Testimonial: (Client did this before Christmas) 
Amanda thanks so much for everything over the last 6 weeks.  I gained a way better knowledge of food. Amanda gave me 3 different styles of food plans and after the 6 weeks I could see what one suits me and what one I can stick with long term. I never felt like I was being deprived if anything I felt like I was eating loads! I can see the benefits of eating small amounts more regularly. I used to eat a lot of crap very late at night but on this plan I felt full and satisfied and didn't feel like I needed to do that. 
Before the plan I probably didn't do enough exercise. I found the exercise the hardest part at the start cause I just wasn't used to it. I liked how flexible Amanda was and she would allow me to change up the exercise. I could do a Zumba and Yoga class in Work so I was allowed swap out a home workout or run and do these when I wanted. Having the change in the exercise suits me I think. Keeps me interested in what i'm doing. I only added in weights after a few weeks in and could see great results once I added in the weights. Can definitely see me sticking to this in the New year. 
Amanda was always available if I had any questions. I liked the accountability side of this as well. Kept me focused. This time of year is very difficult to stay on track but with Amanda's encouragement it made it a lot easier. 
So happy going into Christmas feeling so much better. Besides the physical changes I have noticed improved sleep, better mood, more energy, more confidence. Delighted I did it. Thanks again Amanda.

I'm also so proud of all the gyms have been doing to keep there members ❤️ @fullbodyworkhouse And while physical health during this time is Absolutely vital. Please do not take for granted your mental health ❤️ It's very easy at a time like this with financial worries and future uncertainty for mental health to deteriorate.

.
I'm a big fan of this type of labelling in Australia 👌👌👌
.
.
In Ireland, we have a traffic light system which in my opinion is very flawed. Foods receive green, amber and red lights. It is based solely on calories. Fats contain 9kcal per gram. So technically they are high in calories. But certain foods like nuts, nut butters and avocados while high in calories are full of other nutrients. But fats themselves are essential for fat soluble vitamin absorption, reducing inflammation and it's also an energy source. So should these high calorie foods receive a red light? 🤔 Foods are not just calories. ❌❌❌
.
.
This labelling gives a foodstuff a health indicator rather than a colour. I think it's a much more accurate and truer representation of the food rather than just based on calories alone 👌
.
.
This being said calories are important and you can't just disregard them. Just be mindful and reduce portion size 🤗

18,2020-03-10T10:50:46+0000,"Plant Based is defined as a diet consisting mostly of foods derived from plants, including vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, legumes and fruits. 🤔
.
.
I base most if not all of my meals around plant based foods so... 🤔 So yes I would consider my diet plant based 🥬🥑 And I am in no way vegan. .
.
Veganism is a way of life. I have the height of respect of anyone choosing to do something for health purposes, whether I believe in it or not is irrelevant. But I don't agree with people changing their views or opinions after watching a TV show. I also don't believe anybody should scare monger anyone else into their choices 😔And this goes for anything. Not just food choices. But please don't think by choosing a diet (any diet not just plant based) that automatically makes you exempt from disease. I genuinely know people who take drugs but they adhere to a vegan diet so ya know.... Health 😏
.
.
Anyway the basis of this post is education. Plant based diets don't have to be meat free diets. Natural whole foods like mentioned above should make up a large part of your diet, if health is a priority.  A herbivore is plant based. An omnivore can also be plant based. 🌱

20,2020-03-06T20:56:40+0000,"Pregnancy was once considered a reason to stop all exercise and eat for two. Which often led to excessive weight gain, gestational diabetes, pre eclampsia, difficult births and difficulty with weight loss post partum. Now, obviously pregnancy is massively different for everyone. Unfortunately there is no one size fits all. But the information I'm giving is general recommendations. If you have any further questions. It is probably worth talking it over with your doctor or other medical professional ☺️
.
.
Exercise:
-Studies have shown that exercise during pregnancy can actually lead to easier birthing and healthy weight gain during pregnancy.
-It is also thought to be beneficial for post partum weight loss.
-Guidelines for exercise encourage women to stick with similar exercises prior to pregnancy. Light Resistance based training is highly recommended.
- Adaptations may be needed through different trimesters such as: Not lying on your back for too long or overhead extension exercises may need to be removed. This is very dependent on individuals
- Hiit training may not be recommended after trimester 1 - again very dependent on the individual and their training history but it will become a lot harder
- Light exercise like walking can possibly be done the whole way up until due date
- The main take home point from this is: Exercise during pregnancy is encouraged. Everyone's levels, capabilities and pregnancies are different so go with how you're feeling. Don't over exert yourself. And talk with your coach and doctor 🙏
.
.
Nutrition
- This idea of eating double for two is non sense 🙈
- Calories shouldn't even be increased in first trimester. Daily calories should be increased by about 300Cals in 2nd trimester and 500Cals in 3rd Trimester.
- There may be food aversions or food cravings during pregnancy - this is totally normal.
- Try to stick with whole nutritious foods
- Supplements include: Folic Acid, Vitamin D, Iron and Omega 3 Fatty acids. But talk to your doctor or health are consultant before taking any of these

Something to be very aware of during pregnancy is labelling.

.
This is one that I'm a firm believer in.
.
.
€50 a week to be trained in a top quality facility. Are you serious? No way can I afford that. Yet, you're able to afford to go on the piss every weekend 🤔
.
.
€100 a week on food. That's out of my budget. Yet, you spend €150 ón cigarettes every week 🤔
.
.
€50 for a Sports massage? That's ridiculous. Yet, you spend €70 on lunches out every week 🤔
.
.
2 litres of water is impossible. But 8 coffees a day is manageable?
.
.
Supplements are too expensive but 10 weekly fizzy drinks are cheap?

.
Sometimes you need to start prioritising what is important to you irrelevant of price 🤔🙈 I moved over to Australia with no job after travelling for 5 weeks. I had no full time job since the 20th December until 9th March 😵😵😵 I still managed to eat decently and train. Why? Because that is my priority. I had to make budget so supplements did take a hit but nutritious food and exercise never left my budget. If I had to stay in a night I did. If I couldn't afford a day trip that was fine. But health is priority to me so even with a lack of money I MADE IT WORK.!!!!! You can too.

23,2020-02-28T21:53:53+0000,"New followers here's a brief synopsis of this page and what I'm about:
.
.
1. Health is number 1 priority to me. Not aesthetics. Not calories or macros. Performance is 2nd most important. This was particularly important when I played football and when I was doing Crossfit competitions. Right now, it's not priority because I have just moved to Australia and I was all over the place with training and a schedule etc. But now that I will have one resuming soon, performance will come back big time 👏
.
.
2. I love food. I love educating people on food and nutrition. I love helping build good relationships with food ♥️ I just love what I do. .
.
3. I am so blessed to have the people in my life that I do. I post soppy things about my boyfriend and sister. I definitely don't give my AMAZING friends enough credit. They have been there during good times and bad and I cannot express in words how much I love them.
.
.
4. I am one of these annoying, motivating, smiling at 6am people. But I haven't always been like that. No more than anyone else I've had tough times in my life so don't let that happy exterior fool you 😔
.
.
5. This page was started as a motivator to help me. It's probably done a 360 in recent times. I no longer need motivation as this is now my lifestyle. I eat well, I train hard and I socialise. I'm a normal person. I eat ice cream and drink just not all the time. I don't have abs, but I have strong legs. I sweat in the gym profusely 😂 I'm not some beautiful flawless influencer. I'm real 💯

Today I started a new programme. I'm not gonna lie, I've been slacking on the programme front for quite awhile now🤷 I suppose I didn't really have any set goals for awhile, but there is no mistaking the obvious, programmes work 🙊 They've worked for my clients so why wouldn't I use my own programme 😂 Now I have goals 🤗 So I need to keep a structure. ☑️
If you are doing random workouts without any structure, are you seeing results? 🤔 Are you copying fitness bloggers and expecting results? 🤔 Are you trying to out train a bad diet? 🤔
.
.
Do you really need to be doing the 45 degree Single Arm Lateral Raise with a 4010 tempo? 🤔 Oh but I seen a fitness blogger doing it 💩
.
.
All my fitspos are doing Crossfit now. I'm gonna try to do a Handstand Push Up...🤕🤕🤕
.
.
My favourite online coach says to eat avocados so now I'm force feeding myself avocados 🥑🤦
.
.
Please keep it simple. Most people will never need to do gymnastics so why would you copy me doing this🤦 Get a coach, get accountable, do the basics and eat well. The rest will look after itself 🥰

👉 I am absolutely loving the aray of healthy food options over here. It makes eating well so easy🙏 That being said I haven't been 100% healthy 😅🙈 The unhealthy options are tempting too 😂
👉 There are gyms and fitness centres everywhere 😍🙏 Gone be the days of Asia where I had to trek kms just to get to a gym 😂 Again, the lifestyle is so geared towards health 🤗
👉 Water is readily available. This is a great incentive to refill water at these stations which are located all over the place. Also, there are water taps on bars which has been an absolute life saver for me the last 2 nights out 🙈😂
👉 Last night I got sniffed by a dog for drugs 😳 It was an experience to say the least
👉 On Sundays, all public transport is $2.80. What a great incentive to get out and get exploring.
👉 Coffee is great 😍☕

6,2020-02-13T08:39:05+0000,"💥💥💥Fun fact 💥💥💥
.
.
I didn't eat fruit or vegetables until I went to college (studying to be a nutritionist🙈). And at that it was VERY limited. Maybe the odd orange and carrots with dinner. 🙈 @len_tils was my saviour when I moved to Sheffield with her. She had me eating food I would never ever eat 😂Even if I did make her chop vegetables into the tiniest pieces 😂 My point is I changed a habit. Not only did I change it, I absolutely did a 360 🤗 (I don't do things by halves 😝)
.
.
When people come to me with: I don't eat this or I don't like that or I don't eat any vegetables etc. I see that as a choice. Its absolutely fine if you are one of these people and choose to 'be picky'. No one is expected to like everything 😂 I still cannot eat Cauliflower and I'm not a fan of asparagus but I am much more open to trying new things. And not once, because that is not enough. They say if you still cannot stand something after the 3rd try, there's a good chance you like it. 🤷‍♀️
.
.
💥💥💥Another fun fact 💥💥💥
I only started eating salads about 4 years ago. After years of telling myself I don't like iceberg lettuce and tomatoes (still don't) I realised that's not the only salad that exists 😑😳 If you think you don't like salad, don't make it with items you don't like 😅😜 I base most of mine on rocket or spinach, add as much colour Usually Beetroot, carrot, Cucumber, sun-dried tomato, a cheese and finish it with fruit 😍 I love fruit in salad. And salads shouldn't just be a summer thing🚫🚫🚫Add a warm meat, fish or meat alternative, add a warm grain like cous cous, quinoa or pasta and voila ☑️☑️☑️

Stop holding yourself back from the healthiest version of you 🤗

7,2020-02-10T06:28:15+0000,"What defines health? 🤔
.
.
Let me tell you what I think it is...
.
.
❌Health is not a low body fat
❌Health is not training excessively
❌Health is not clean eating
❌Health is not being mindful
❌Health is not sleeping 8 hours a day
❌Health is not 1 thing
.
.
Health is different to everyone. Health has a physical aspect but it has a huge mental aspect too. Obsessing about calories is not healthy, YOLOing isn't either. A measure on a scales is certainly not a definition of health. Eating whole nutritious foods is amazing but if you are constantly thinking about all the foods 'you can't have', that's not healthy. Sleeping 8 hours a day but stressing for the other 16 is not healthy. And training is important but if it's consuming you, affecting relationships, affecting your physical or mental health that obviously is not healthy.
.
.
I want to help people. I want to help them develop a healthy relationship with food and exercise. I want to help them stop being so hard on themselves and celebrate little victories. I want to cut this idea that exercise is just a way to burn calories. I want people to stop obsessing over calories. I want to help ❤️ if you want my help. Pm me.

My main aim is to find a lifestyle that is healthy and sustainable. Healthy doesn't always mean 'eating healthy foods' sometimes showing people they can have 'treats' actually makes people healthier. I deal with all my clients individually and help them create a healthy relationship with food and exercise.
.
.
I would say at least 90% of my clients have disordered eating in some form. Some know it, some don't. I have had it. And I've found a light at the end of a tunnel. So this is my main aim. Yes, I give nutrition plans. Yes, I provide training plans. But my programmes are more than that.

15,2020-01-29T06:15:23+0000,"I am so excited to finally become an actual Crossfit member in Australia 🙈

I started Crossfit about a year ago but due to Inter County football I could never give it full commitment. In season (January - October) I was probably only doing it once or twice a week. As soon as Championship started I actually had to give it up as training intensity was just too high and I'm no spring chicken anymore😂
In season I competed in 2 competitions, which I took podium at both🥇🥉
As soon as football was finished I had time to give it my full commitment. I did my first Open which was the biggest learning experience🙏 And I did my first competition with training🏆

Why Crossfit?
I have been training consistently at a high level for at least 14 years. I have played Intercounty football since I was 12 and anyone that knows me as a player, knows my (probably only) strength is my engine. So I have a very good capacity. I have also been consistently weight training for 5 years so my strength is decent too. I have a huge competitive nature so pushing myself outside my comfort zone is something that I thoroughly enjoy. Crossfit seemed like a perfect match and so far it's ticking all the right boxes☑️☑️☑️ I also absolutely love the incredible sense of achievement and community spirit within it 😊

Do I recommend Crossfit to everyone?
Like with any high intensity sport, injuries happen. Up until now, I have trained for Crossfit alone. Something I would not recommend to people. I am a fully Qualified trainer (not crossfit coach) but I'm competent in in my exercise execution. If you are a beginner, I would recommend getting a baseline before starting crossfit. And get a good trainer. Unfortunately, Crossfit gets a bad rap for under Qualified coaches but this is actually minimal. I have yet to come across a bad one, but they exist (and not just in Crossfit may I add, i have seen worse in the GAA). To answer the above question, no I do not Recommend RX Crossfit to everyone. But that doesn't mean that everyone cannot enjoy it to a certain level. Most gyms do some sort of cross training🤷‍♀️ I do not endorse Crossfit. I do not recommend it for everyone. But right now, I'm loving it ❤️🙏",102,3,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/82042924_488658305175190_3773576666076484831_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=k44_gZnYcCUAX9ALgM6&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfCZqKYiKY4n6C2moy1nzDDiArfk4SyDYDuv9ZNVjoBBjg&oe=63D7E1E0,https://www.instagram.com/p/B75KUZjhGLg/,17852834680823453,,"[{'timestamp': '2020-01-29T10:06:06+0000', 'text': 'Did you meet @davedriskell 🤔 ps I’m so jealous of your trip to Bali and to @crossfitwanderlust_bali', 'username': 'lainey_moo', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2020-01-29T11:34:56+0000', 'text': '@lainey_moo afraid not but it was absolutely amazing.

20,2020-01-22T22:59:35+0000,"Tips on travelling and how to maintain a  good lifestyle while away:
.
.
1. Don't drink your calories.
 If you are going to go on the lash every day chances are you will gain weight 😒 Also, if you're adding a lot of extra calories through drinks (even healthy ones) you may put on weight. Let's take a smoothie for breakfast with breakfast, a milkshake with lunch, sipping on Fanta throughout the day and 2 cocktails at night. That will probably clock up an extra 500-1000 cals a day. 🙊 Stick to water. Or a coke zero is an absolute life saver if you're craving a little sweetness 🙏
.
.
2. You don't need to be in the gym to stay active.
 Did you know your NEAT contributes more to your metabolic rate than Purposeful exercise? I may not be training much but I'm getting between 15-30k steps every day. So get swimming, walking, hiking or kayaking. If you want to laze by the pool, that's fine but don't be suprised if your body feels tired and sluggish 😬
.
.
3. Get at least one decent meal in.
 I try to opt for eggs and fruit for breakfast. This way I can leave a little lenancy for dinner 😜 You should enjoy yourself at the end of the day but you want to feel good at the same time. Try opt to snack on fruit and nuts instead of ice cream and crisps the whole time 🙊
.
.
4. I'm weird about salads in developing countries. The water is so dirty over here so if that's what they use to clean it, I try to veer away. I do get veggies cooked, normally in a curry or stir fry 👌
.
.
5. That leads me onto my next point. Be weary of meat. I tend to go pescatarian when away as the meat quality just isn't  the same 🙈
.
.
6. A few things to have handy: Bug Spray, tissues, plasters, iodine, after sun, antibacterial gel, wipes and a fan 😂😂😂
.
.
7. Invest in a Go Pro. They are worth it.
.
.
Travel is amazing and should be enjoyed but if you want to stay comfortable and not self conscious maybe points 1-3 may help. 4 to 7 are just some of my tips and to be honest I probably have a million more I've forgotten 🙊

.
.
Each year since my Dad died I have vowed to put myself first. I'm not great at it tbh. I let work come first, football, looking after others and my needs and wants came after all those things 🙈
.
.
If my friends or family, hear the word organised they will probably think of me. I organise my organisation 😂😂😂 So when I decided to leave my job and head to the other side of the world at (almost) 29, I'd say people couldn't believe it 🙈 But it's something I had to do. ❤️
.
.
I genuinely thought I'd be married and have a child before 30. I thought I'd have my career sorted. But dya know what... I couldn't be happier. I am currently travelling with the love of my life @o_boyce and with no job organised we hope to start up a new adventure in Sydney.
.
.
It's OK to be almost 30 and not have a certain plan. It's OK to not have a mortgage. It's OK to be single. It's OK to not have a career. .
.
Life is what you make it. You are a product of your environment. I believe good things are coming my way so here's to a positive outlook on 2020❤️🙌 I hope you all have the same YOLO attitude 🙋
.
.
P. S Beach pics will cease for awhile as I am currently in Kuala Lumpur and it is raining 🤣🤣🤣

.

I took part in Amanda's 6 week programme and it was honestly one of the best things I've ever done for myself! After just moving jobs my routine and head was all over the place, I always loved the gym but looking for a new job took over and I didn't have any motivation for working out. I decided to do this programme to get me back into the right mindset which it did, I wanted a food plan that I could maintain and wasn't impossible to stick too (ie I could have amazing chocolate bars FibreOne will forever be my favourite treat lol😂) and I also wanted a gym plan that was sustainable which it is! Amanda was always at the end of the phone to answer any questions, the online Facebook group had plenty of demos to help and her phone calls and Voice tags were always so encouraging! She really knows what she is talking about and you can tell she truly passionate about her clients. I have never felt better and i am going to carry on with my new lifestyle 😍❤️ I started at 71.1kg and I'm down to 69.9kg (I did want to get back in the 60 zone) I have toned up and feel super healthy all thanks to a wonderful programme by Amanda 😘 Xxx

11,2019-12-28T17:28:08+0000,"As you can see from my feed I have began to love Crossfit 💋
.
.
I didn't always love it and actually I was a huge skeptic. My friends know this as some of them have questioned me on it 🤔 But my views and opinions on so many things over the years have changed. I also believed that a restrictive 'clean' diet was the healthiest diet there could be, forgetting the impact that restriction has on your mental health 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
.
.
I have made so many mistakes over the years I've been in the health and fitness industry. I've called foods 'good' and 'bad', and I've shunned certain exercise routines. But from experience comes knowledge and wisdom. 🙏 And I am a lot more open minded to things now 👌
.
.
I don't think Crossfit is for everyone. It's a seriously stringent training regime which requires a huge level of mobility, strength and conditioning. Even at a regressed level, it can be overwhelming and injury levels can be high due to poor training technique or poor coaching (this is obviously not all coaches). But I also don't think everyone should be running. Poor running technique can contribute to any number of problems with joints, ligaments, tendons or muscle strains.
.
.
I am a firm believer in anyone starting out on a fitness journey, to look around. Find what works for you. There's not a one size fits all. I would normally say to get a coach to steer you in the right direction and then you'll find a lifestyle you can enjoy ❤️ Because exercise should not be a punishment 🙏

14,2019-12-23T17:19:21+0000,"I actually love Cardio 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️(except rowingit's the devil's exercise 😂) .
.
Coming from a football background, cardio was my first love fitness wise 👌I'm not gonna lie, I love that breathlessness feeling. I feel it always shows me I've pushed myself 😉 And being honest, running is the highest my heart rate goes to (even when I don't think it and some of the other sessions I do feel way worse 🙈)
And I'm one of the very few Assault Bike fans.
. .
But let me tell you something, if you think you're going to change your body shape by doing cardio alone. You're so wrong 🙈
.
.
Sweat should not be a determinant of a 'good session'. Again, I love the feeling of a good sweaty session. But quite often my weights sessions barely work a pore, does this mean they are not as beneficial? ABSOLUTELY NOT!!! Resistance training is and should be priority. No matter what your goals?
👉 Weight loss, gain or maintenence (along with calorie manipulation)
👉 Reduce injury risk
👉 Stronger bones, joints, ligaments, tendons
👉 General strength and fitness
.
.
If you have not already realised how important resistance training is, make it a goal and priority for 2020 💪

.
.
Every other year I've given tips on 'how to not lose all your hard work over Christmas'. This year I'm taking a different approach.
.
.
I plan to train less over Christmas. Before, I would panic about this. Oh but 'Will I lose all my strength?'. 'What about all the chocolate I've eaten'😭 I now have a good relationship with exercise. I don't plan on sitting on my arse all Christmas but my normal 6 day training week will probably reduce to 3. Why? To facilitate for spending time with friends and family ❤️ This Christmas is even more important than others that I spend valuable time with friends and family as I'm moving in 2.5 weeks 😱 But training is a part of my lifestyle so I won't be going cold turkey on it (Christmas pun or what🤪)
.
.
As always I will enjoy myself. But as usual, good nutritious food makes me feel best so I will stick mostly to what I know and enjoy the treats too ✌️ I won't take the p#*s. 🐷🚫
.
.
Lastly and most importantly, when the 5th of January rocks up and I'm about to get into a bikini I will not be hard on myself. I will cherish the weeks over Christmas. I will be grateful for the food I CAN eat. I won't be resentful of the extra few pounds I will probably gain. And I will rock that bikini 👙🌟
.
.
Christmas starts for me today 🎊🌟🎉Haha although I know for most it started 2 weeks ago 🍹🍸🍬🍴 #christmasisaroundthecorner #holidaysarecoming #behappy #begrateful #happinessis #fitliving #fitlifestyle #eatforhealth #eatforperformance #fitfam #irishfitfam",118,5,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/78801206_830555317414342_5455851926155725714_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=DGEJppSObecAX-T3be6&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfBfVly1eMTSYo3NzlQ88nEPirq8vSR3whRoBUMngjTu6w&oe=63D7C6AB,https://www.instagram.com/p/B6Sar7iB0tZ/,17916756145365494,,"[{'timestamp': '2019-12-20T09:41:36+0000', 'text': 'Preach it sista...haven’t dieted in months now and still happy out! 🙌 Have a nice one!', 'username': 'sarahconnollycoaching', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2019-12-20T10:21:11+0000', 'text': '@sarahconnollyperformance same to you 🎅🎉', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '17882692963475965'}]}, 'id': '17850669637740192'}, {'timestamp': '2019-12-20T08:54:07+0000', 'text': '@o_boyce your face 😂😂', 'username': 'orlabreathnach', 'like_count': 2, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2019-12-23T07:57:51+0000', 'text': '@orlabreathnach of all the photos she had to put up🤔🤣', 'username': 'o_boyce', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '18113740360071393'}, {'timestamp': '2019-12-20T09:25:50+0000', 'text': '@orlabreathnach  the best part 😂', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 2, 'id': '17849596246776825'}]}, 'id': '17887445116456324'}]",,

.
.
A lot of you had asked will I be training on holidays 🤔 The plan is to definitely keep up a minimum level of training while travelling while including a lot of hiking and extra steps 👣👣👣
.
.
I'm not gonna lie, a good gym is what motivates me 💪 I don't have much interest in a Hiit Bodyweight session 🙈 But if there is no option for a good gym in some of the places I am here are some of the exercises I will keep up 🤞
.
.
1. Skipping - This is definitely one I will be keeping up. Since I bought my new rope I'm going to use this as an opportunity to improve my DUs
2. Squats - BW air Squats are pretty easy for me so I've progressed them to pulse Squats here
3. Lunges - Again, normal Lunges are pretty regressed for me so I've added an OH Walking Lunge option
4. Push Ups - Still one of the hardest exercises to perfect
5. Core Work - Being honest I probably won't do these as I hate doing isolated core work but I've added it in for any of you thinking about home workouts 😜
.
.
I will probably add Burpees as I love a good Burpee but not everyone can or should do them so I haven't added them. Hope this helps some of you 😁 I hope to do most of my training in gyms but this is an option for when there are no gyms to avail of 🤷‍♀️ #fullbodyworkout #fitliving #fitlife #fitlifestyle #eatforhealth #eatforperformance #exercise #fitfam #irishfitfam",85,0,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/80716179_555761061934246_1587285890481502706_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=T1w_TgFeHX4AX-DwxA8&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfDfKFKtUxTf3RM3W-rukcJGy41U2X3IU6SqsQk53V3Zjg&oe=63D8FB55,https://www.instagram.com/p/B6OSVY-hAmq/,18075073972160587,,,,
20,2019-12-15T20:35:32+0000,"It's easy to assume I've always been confident 🤔
.
.
I've always been the loudest in the room
.
I've never been afraid to show a little skin
.
Attention seeker was my middle name
.
.
Delve a little deeper and you'd have seen a very vulnerable girl, terrified to show how insecure she truely was 😢
I was the girl who couldn't be seen without make up. The girl who was more than uncomfortable in her own skin 😩 I conformed to norms & standards that I thought I 'had to'. I was being someone I wasn't. And I'm well aware this is a vast majority of women unfortunately 😭
.
.
But I'm at a stage in my life where I am now so happy and confident in myself ❤️
A girl who once thought I had to have life sorted by 30 is off to Austrailia next year.✈️ A girl who was obsessed with having a 'perfect body' is thriving in her strong body 💪 Instead of designer handbags and expensive jewellery, I'm more interested in what tattoo I'm going to get next 😂 And did I mention I got a nose piercing at 28 😜
.
.
So don't make assumptions. Yes I'm at a place in my life where I'm happy, but I haven't always been there. It can take a long time. It takes a lot of self care. But it's worth it. And don't be afraid to be who you are 💕

2,2019-11-28T17:26:26+0000,"I've always been very open minded. I pride myself on it actually. I've alway been a pro choice kinda girl in all aspects of life (not just health and fitness related). You'll never hear me boast about one type of diet or slate any either. You won't hear me downgrade any form of exercise, although I do openly talk about the huge benefits of resistance training 💪 I'll never tell any of my client's 'You have to do this type of exercise' or 'you cannot eat this for weight loss'. So you see I'm very open minded. If someone who loves yoga comes to me, I'm not going to force them to lift weights. And if someone who is vegan comes to me, I would not force them to eat animal products. My problem with any of these things lies in the misinformation. .
.
Did you know that vegan fast food production has sky rocketed in recent years? 🤔 Similarly, a few years ago, gluten free products were a huge trend? And before that, sugar free was the hype? This I have a problem with.
.
.
Veganism is a lifestyle choice. I have huge respect for anyone's lifestyle choices, whether they conform to my own is irrelevant. What actually annoys me is actual vegans are getting a terrible name due to all these people jumping on the bandwagon, thinking veganism is the healthiest lifestyle going. People are going into this lifestyle, uneducated and naive. 😒 It was the same a few years ago when gluten free was the buzzword. Did you know you can have a totally adequate, balanced, healthy diet without adding one gluten free product? And thats for ACTUAL coeliacs out there, because they are the ONLY people that need to be eating gluten free toast 😂
.
.
What my very long winded post is trying to say is stop jumping on bandwagons. If you are and always have been vegan, that's fine. Continue with your choices. If you are coeliac, continue with your gluten free bread 🙈 For the rest of you, stop following trends by the latest celebrity diet. Stop conforming to social norms ✊ Stop basing your beliefs on a bloody stupid documentary 😒 Get some advice from a professional. 🙏 Follow said advice 🌈 And stop eating Vegan Fast Food, surely it tastes revolting?

.
.
These are my 2 of my biggest priorities at the moment ❤️✈️
.
.
But let me tell you this. One is much more important than the other. Because without one, we would be seriously limited 🤔
.
.
Health should be EVERYONES number 1 priority. Health is different to everyone. It's not necessarily eating clean or training. But it involves a physical and mental component. Without good health, we restrict ourselves in so many ways. It should be a priority over every single other goal/task in your life ❤️
.
.
For me prioritising my health involves:
🙏 Eating a diet with wholesome, nutritious food but not depriving myself if I want some chocolate
🙏 Exercising daily - because I love my body, not hate it
🙏 Social interactions - I thrive on talking to people. Always have. My job helps me with this. If I'm not working, I'm meeting friends and family
🙏 Organisation - sounds silly but not being organised would spark anxiety problems. I don't want that therefore, I am highly organised
🙏 Sleep - no explanation needed
🙏 Being selfish from time to time - I've always been selfless. I've always put everyone else first. These days I have a healthy balance ❤️
🙏 Reading - whether it's light reading or learning
.
.
If you are not prioritising your health you need to. You need to start doing things for yourself. You need to start looking after your body because believe me, we won't be here forever 😔

But choose wisely 🤔

.
Not all foods are equal.
.

So take the humble sausage. A staple in a good 'Irish Breakfast'. There are different types of sausages: Veggie or meat. Then meat can be broken down into: pork, turkey, chicken, beef... But even a meat sausage can be 50% meat (50% God knows what) or it can be 85%. It can be 80 calories or 280 calories. It can be grilled or it can be fried 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ So is a sausage really just a sausage? 🤔
.
.
What I recommend:
👉 A sausage is no harm in moderation. And I mean moderation. It is still processed even the highest quality ones.
👉 Check calorie content - huge differences between products
👉 Grill don't fry

We should all be doing it. It's actually so important 🙈 You wouldn't say the things you say about yourself about anyone else 😔😔😔 In the words of Jess Glynne 'Don't be so hard on yourself'.

.
.
EXPECTATIONS before the Competition :
👉 Compete in Scaled and try to finish all Wods.
.
.
REALITY:
👉 Surpassed every expectation possible 🙆🙆🙆
.
.
20.1 - Learnt me to NEVER EVER do an Open Workout hungover - this is the only workout I can say I'm a little disappointed with as I know I could have done better had I not went on the tear the night before 😂
.
.
20.2 - Learnt me Double Unders are my ARCH NEMISIS... 😭 I absolutely hate them but will continue to try and improve
.
.
20.3 - Made me realise doing elevated HSPUs has not helped 😔😂 From the ground is sooo much harder. Huge improvements in these. Not the most neck friendly exercise 😏
.
.
20.4 - My favourite ❤️ I pushed past all expectations in this one. Learning to do split jerks and realising I can actually do pistols 😜
.
.
20.5 - Made me realise I still have a LONG way to go 👆👆👆
.
.
This was one of the most amazing experiences ever. I know I sound dramatic but I actually mean it. I came into this Open having very little experience and even less knowledge. I have been a part time Crossfitter at best so to be able to compete in all RX wods was beyond any expectation I ever had. Each week I pushed outside every boundary I have ever built. And believe me, its something we can all do. In any area of life 💕
.
.
To top it all off I achieved my goal of top 20% in the country. (I was actually even close to my TOTALLY unrealistic goal of top 100). To my amazement I even placed in the top 20% in the World 😍💪 This sport is not for everyone but it is DEFINITELY FOR ME 🙏Watch this space 💪😜
.
.
Massive thanks to @fusion_mma_crossfit_cuchulainn and @craughwell17_ who helped me every week. Honestly, without their encouragement this could have been a totally different post 🙏

.
.
If you are like my clients and making a conscious effort everyday to create new, better habits. Then well done 👏👏👏
.
.
It's not about perfection. It's about consistency. It's about 'trying'. If a client says to me, 'Amanda I had a meal out for my sister' s birthday, I stuck to a decent dinner but I did have dessert'😬. I count this as a win. Before, this client would have a starter, main and dessert without even a thought about the nutrition content of the food. Now, they are making a conscious decision to have a healthier dinner but still enjoy dessert. They didn't overdo it by having 3 courses. It's about progress, not perfection 👏👏👏
.
.
On the other hand, if someone told me, they went out of their way to order a takeaway 'because they had a bad week at work'. I'd be a little less impressed 🤐 I try to help my clients with emotional eating. And not using food as a coping mechanism. Again, it's about progress. If this happened once, mistakes happen. If it was a continuous cycle, I would express my disappointment. 😏
.
.
I said last week I was going to try and 'treat myself' less frequently. Which to be fair, I actually did. But then I visited family over the weekend and they were all about treating me 😂 I enjoyed myself but I didn't take the absolute piss either 😒 My goals are not aesthetic based and are more based on energy and performance levels so I want to keep my diet as nutritious as possible as that's the food that makes me feel the best 💪
.
.
If you want to change, I mean really WANT to change, make small changes. If you don't, that's fine too, but stop wasting your time, your money and your energy 🙄

If you're counting calories and don't want to fully give up on these little treats why not sub your sliced pan for a corncake.

14,2019-11-06T08:16:18+0000,"❓❓❓Did you know that Whey is a by product of cheese production? Yes you heard right. Its a simple dairy bi product that is dried and may have lactose or fats removed during production 🙈❓❓❓
.
.
So if you are on the bandwagon of thinking whey protein has some sort of steroid included or has some sort of extra powers, I'm afraid your both wrong.
.
.
It's not needed in everyone's diets. But if you are someone who:
👉 Does not get enough protein in their diet its a good source of protein and is convenient and easily absorbed.
👉 Trains a lot and finds it hard to get in the amount of protein you need. It's a great addition. Remember it is a supplement do that's exactly what it should do. Supplement the diet.
.
.
🚫 It will not make you bulky
🚫 It is not only for athletes
🚫 It is not only required after the gym
.
.
I'm not going to compare it nutritionally to milk. But if you're a person who would drink a glass of milk, but wouldn't drink a protein shake, maybe think twice 🤔

.
.
If I had my way, I would start women on a journey of self love from their early teens. This is an age they can be thought to love themselves and their bodies ♥️ Its an age they start to learn, develop and mould their personalities. The older we get and the longer we hate our bodies the harder it is to get away from that idea 😪 And I'm saying this from experience. I had so many body confidence issues😭
.
.
But it starts with you 👆👆👆
.
.
👉 Start Loving what your body CAN do not what it can't
👉 Appreciate your strengths - we all have them. Stop focusing on your weaknesses
👉 Take more time for yourself
👉 Stop using exercise as a tool to punish yourself for what you've eaten
👉 Look at food as energy and nutrients not focusing solely on calories 👉 Surround yourself with incredible people who lift you up, not put you down
👉 Remove toxicity - relationships, friends, feelings
👉 Pay someone a compliment - saying something nice to someone actually has a positive effect on the giver, not just the receiver. And what comes around goes around 🙏
👉 STOP COMPARING YOURSELF TO OTHERS - THIS IS THE THIEF OF ALL JOY. YOU ARE NOT SOMEONE ELSE. STOP TRYING TO BE LIKE SOMEONE ELSE 🚫

.
.
I actually understand how hard it is to reduce or eliminate foods we all enjoy like chocolate 🤤 Or Crisps, maybe even Bread or Takeaways. These foods usually require a lot of make you full (satiation). But there does come a point where you will feel full. Liquid calories however will never leave you feeling sated. 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
.
.
1. Liquid calories include juices we consider 'just a drink', they may be a healthier option but they contain calories too. This is a very easy way to cut calories by eliminating these juices and replacing with water.
.
.
2. Fizzy drinks. This one still baffles me. I'm not a fizzy drink fan but the odd time I get a little craving 😜 But there are 'zero' options in EVERY drink these days 🤷‍♀️Why would you even consider the sugar alternative!? 😏
.
.
3. Alcohol contains calories. Quite often a lot of them. Drinking is fine. But be aware it doesn't go unaccounted for. But 'banking calories' for drinking can have dangerous consequences. Firstly, drunkoxeria is a very real thing. People starving themselves the day of a drinking binge 'to save calories'. Can we please stop saying things are 'bad' and 'good'. Go out every so often. Drink a sensible amount. Be aware it's not calorie free. The end.
.
.
4. Hot drinks. Tis the season and all that🥶 Hot chocolates and festive coffees are a sure way to boost your daily calorie consumption without a second thought. And I can tell you those 400 cals will not leave you as full as a nice chicken salad would 🥗😏 We all love a good hazelnut latte but let's just keep it as a treat, not a daily lunchtime special 😜 You'll save yourself some cash too for Christmas 😝

I'm always telling people to get out of a comfort zone... And I have to admit I don't think I come out of my own enough 🤔

I've always worked on what I'm good at. And I've pushed myself to limits I didn't think even exist. But I have to admit I've had a tendency along the way to neglect what I'm not good at 🙈
.
.
I did it in school. I was good at science and Home Ec so I worked really hard at these subjects and excelled. But English (my dreaded subject) never got the same attention 😮
.
.
I did it in football. I was always fit. But I constantly worked to be fitter instead of working on weaknesses like kicking and shooting 🙈 Oh what could have been 😂
.
.
I've done it in the gym. I've worked hard on improving my strengths while some very obvious weaknesses were left by the wayside. 😮😳
.
.
In the last 3 weeks I have pushed myself harder than I've ever pushed myself... MENTALLY!!!! First with those damn double unders and this weekend with hspus. Before Friday I could only do elevated hspus. Then Friday I miraculously hit 13 reps 😂 Yesterday, I finished the 21 reps. 🥳🥳🥳 Proud is an understatement. 👏👏👏 From now on, I promise to try and work on weaknesses a lot more, In all aspects of my life 🙏

.
.
Do you understand the optimal body composition? 🤔
.
.
So as we know we are made up of bone, ligaments, tendons, organs, muscle and fat. 🙈 Yes we all have it. And we all need a certain amount, especially women.
.
Our optimal body composition is to have a lower body fat mass (in healthy proroption s 18 - 28% woman and 8 - 18% man) and a higher lean muscle mass. We also would like a good bone density with strong joints. Strong, healthy, functioning organs would really top it off 👌
.
.
What if I told you with a good, balanced diet and some consistency you could achieve this 🙈😮
.
.
Yes, resistance training ticks all of the above boxes ☑️ Now it's pretty useless information alone because we cannot out train a bad diet but to make a start, try out some bands or body weight exercises. I personally recommend a trainer. Invest in one even just to learn the Ropes and keep you accountable initially.
.
.
And nó you don't have to become an Olympic weightlifter or Crossfitter. Just start with the basics. Learn how to Squat, Bench and Deadlift. Do some assistance exercises. Throw in a little cardio for your heart and lungs ♥️ It doesn't have to be over complicated.

Thank me later 💋

Testimonial:
Amanda was just amazing! The amount of support and help I  received day to day and the details in The plans were just amazing. I gained knowledge I can use forever and a new understanding of food.

I started this programme post new baby when I felt most unhappy with my “new” body having never felt uncomfortable in myself it was a brand new feeling- however with amanda i have been able to gain confidence in myself and a new respect for what your body can do. She didn’t just help with food and workouts she helped with a mindset without even realizing. In total I lost 32cm off my body and feel back to myself.

Thank you for everything it was a tough but amazing 8 weeks and I am so grateful I gave myself the time and energy I deserved in doing this.

Hi, my name is Amanda and I have been doing Crossfit part time since this time last year. Unfortunately with football I could not give it full commitment. At most I trained for it twice a week. And I took the whole summer off to focus on football 😔So signing up for this open I thought. I'll just do scaled everything. I was encouraged to give rx a try when I can 😳

.
On Friday, I did 20.2. I did every single one of my du's as singles. I was really disappointed with my score. I spent Friday evening trying to no avail. I cried Saturday morning because my mind was just NOT helping me with these😭  Saturday morning I spent over an hour doing du's. I whipped myself to a point I almost drew blood and I had calf doms (first time😂)...
Last night, I did 4 extra rounds in 20.2 ❤️ it is no score to write home about but within 2 days I have done that.

.
.
Firstly, this is just a generic reference. It doesn't take into account body weight or goals but it's a good guide all the same 👌
.
.
Protein - palm size portion with every meal. Meat, fish, eggs, Yogurt, cottage cheese
.
Vegetables (not fruit, fruit is a cárb) - fistful with every meal.
.
Carbs - cupped handful with most meals. Grains, peas, fruit, rice, pasta, bread etc
.
Fats - thumbful with most meals. Opt for healthy options like avocado, oils, nuts, nut butter
.
.
Portion size is often a problem.
Other ways to avoid over eating:
🍽️ Try reducing plate size.
🍞 Avoid trigger foods. Contrary to popular belief bread does NOT make you fat. However, if you are having 6 slices of bread a day and you over eat it causing you to be in a calorie surplus you will gain weight 😑 If you feel there are foods like this in your diet that you cannot stop eating, I do recommend eliminating. At least for awhile until you can gain control back on them. It does tend to be carbohydrate dense foods like bread, and pasta. Personally, I keep these as a 'treat' rather than a dietary staple 👌

🚫 You're the first person to get blame (especially on match reports)
🚫 You're constantly under pressure
🚫 You get absolutely no recognition (unless you score)
🚫 It's very rare to be nominated for Player of the match (unless again you score)
🚫 You can tackle the exact same as a forward, but you're tackles will result in frees😩

I often get asked some of the following:
⚡ How many days a week SHOULD you train?
Answer: How many time a week CAN you train? There is absolutely no point committing to a 5 day programme if all you can fit in is 3/4. You're already setting yourself up for a fail. There is no Right amount of days to train but there is what's right for you
.
⚡ Is rest not important?
Answer: Recovery is vital. Recovery is done through nutrition, hydration, sleep and reducing intensity/volume. Recovery does not necessarily mean sitting on your arse for the day 🤔 I prefer an active recovery with some light movement. You don't need to be totally sedentary.
.
⚡ Is Crossfit not dangerous?
Answer: If you have the capacity, you can increase the load. I'm a huge advocate of the sport but as with ALL sports of course there is a level of risk involved. The problem often lies in the person or trainer rather than the exercise prescription. If you have never done an Olympic lift before and try Snatch 50kg of course it's dangerous 🙄 But I put the problem down to you more than the sport. It may be benificial for any newbies to either start off with some level if weight training or invest in a really good coach ✌️
.
⚡What exercise is Best?
Answer: The one you enjoy and can adhere to ✌️ But if you want the most bang for your buck and are willing to try anything, it doesn't get more beneficial than resistance training 💪
. ⚡How do you keep motivated all the time? You never stop!
Answer: This one is simple. I love it❤️ I love training. I love fuelling my body right. I love that my body is capable of training so hard. We should be so grateful for all we CAN do 😍

Purposeful exercise is NOT enough. 🙈
.
.
What makes up the body's need for energy? (Aproximations) ⚡ 60% BMR - this rate is affected by genetics, environment, food consumption, overall activity etc
⚡ 10% TEF - this is the energy we need to breakdown and absorb food. Certain foods like protein rich foods have a high thermic effect, therefore eating more of them results in higher TEF.
⚡20% NEAT - This is the exercise we do involuntarily like walking, housework, gardening or playing with kids.
⚡10% Purposeful Exercise

Let's say Sarah is trying to lose X kg. Sarah  is 87kg and has been highly inactive her whole life. Her diet is and always has been highly processed. She works a desk job and her family have 'always carried a few pounds'. So Sarah starts resistance training 4 times a week. But she is still sedentary outside of those 4 sessions. And she hasn't cleaned up her diet....what do you think will happen? Sarah will seriously struggle to lose weight 😔
.
Eileen on the other hand is 67kg and back to the gym twice a week after having a baby. She trained 4 times a week up until having Thomas. She has always had a healthy lifestyle which she maintained while pregnant and breastfeeding. Her diet is protein rich with lots of fruit and vegetables and the odd treat 😜 She plays with Thomas daily...
Will it be easier for Eileen even though she has less weight to lose?
Absolutely 👌👌👌
.
.
Purposeful exercise is great and should be part of a weekly routine. But it is only a very small piece of the puzzle. Don't forget what we put in our mouths has a huge impact on our BMR and burns energy through TEF. NEAT is often over looked and has more impact on TDEE than Purposeful exercise. It's a much larger picture than 'just going to the gym'. #tdee #neatup #tef #eatforhealth #eatforperformance #fitliving #fitlifestyle #fitfam #healthylifestyle #healthiswealth #irishfitfam",40,1,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/70960289_512217349562148_60808206446081912_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=wBBAz0WNZasAX_PeRmf&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfCVBPxvbi8bm1PVVFf8JtJBic1sstschV37TvZhihFIgA&oe=63D89073,https://www.instagram.com/p/B3Y80vroBEJ/,17859643228553647,,"[{'timestamp': '2019-10-10T10:44:26+0000', 'text': '💪🙌🙌', 'username': 'roscommonpeople', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '18000457750269897'}]",,
6,2019-10-08T12:00:35+0000,"People often ask me what exercise is 'best for your bum', 'how do I get rid of love handles', or 'can you target my bingo wings'. Unfortunately, we cannot spot reduce🙈 If it were that easy we'd all be walking around with 'perfect' bodies 😜
.
.
But if there was one exercise I would recommend it would be the Deadlift 🙂 It is a compound movement that really hits many muscle groups 💪 Unfortunately, it is often executed incorrectly and is almost always recommended by health professionals to 'stay away from' if they have injuries. Which is such a pity because if executed properly it can actually help strengthen muscle groups and reduce the incidence of injury 😔
.
.
I have demonstrated 4 different types of Deadlifts. There are more. Some may have to adjust for lever length or injury etc. But the main take home points of a Deadlift.
➡️ Hip hinge. If you can master this movement. You have mastered a lot of the exercise and many other exercises. I recommend practising with a dowel until fully comfortable with this position.
➡️ 3 points of contact. If you were to put a dowl on your back it should touch your head, in between shoulder blades and glutes. If one is not in position, your position is not correct.
➡️ Slow and controlled movement. Make sure not to Jerk the weight.
Point to note. Remember, we have muscles in our lower back so if you have a little bit of pain following Deadlifts it may often be DOMS. Don't automatically think the worst. But if the problem persists, seek professional help. I would always recommend to get a qualified trainer or physio to watch your form before executing Deadlifts 👌

9,2019-10-04T09:11:16+0000,"Let's talk disordered eating ⚠️⚠️⚠️
.
.
I've always said I've never had an eating disorder e.g anoxeria, bulimia. But that doesn't mean I've never had disordered eating. An eating disorder sometimes doesn't capture the full range of complexity of people's eating experiences 🤔🤔🤔
.
.
Unfortunately, most people in their lifetime will have some sort of disordered eating. Even those that think they don't 😔 With the society we live in these days, this has become even more prevalent. The strive for perfection in everything we do has become extreme. The pressure to look a certain way. It's no wonder everyone has a form of disordered eating 😔
.
.
So what kind of behaviours fall into the Disordered Eating (DE) category:
👉 Restriction and tight control of food
👉 Routines and rules are food (certain foods are 'BAD' or when someone should eat)
👉 Bingeing
👉 Compensation for binging - purging, over exercise, fasting
👉Anxiety and Avoidance - eating out, social events etc
👉 Orthorexia - obsession with healthy eating
👉 Body Dysmorphia - distorted body image
.
.
Sadly, I can safely say in my lifetime I have experienced ALL of the above😔 And I'm sure I'm not alone.
.
.
I will not say I'm 110% body confident or happy all the time but thankfully I am rid of my disordered eating. It's not easy. It takes a lot of self acceptance. It takes talking - be that to a friend, family member, counsellor. It takes accepting there is an underlying issue and this behaviour is as a result of that. Its not easy but it can be done 💕
.

Testimonial: 
I started Amanda's 8 week programme for 3 reasons. My first goal was to have a better relationship with food. Prior to this my diet lacked essential nutrients and vitamins. I didnt prep for my days at work and made poor food judgments. I had at least one Dominios a week and lived for it. Now i'm cooking meals i never would have, prepping for my days at work and havent had a dominos in 8 weeks😁. My second goal was to have more energy. I gave up a life long hobby a couple of years ago which was main source of excerise. I have hated any other excerise since then. I hate the gym and i was  dragged by my sister to engage in any type of activity over the  last few months . Since the programme, i'm loving excerise.  I look forward to going for my run in the fresh air and love the home work outs. My energy levels have increased two fold and im ready and waiting for  my sister to come get me now . My last goal was to lose weight as im  getting married next year. In the 8 weeks i have lost over a stone and have really noticed it my clothes. 
Amanda has been great over the 8 weeks. I nearly gave up on day 2 but with Amandas enthusiasm and expertise i kept going and got the results i wanted. It hasnt been just a 8 week programme for me, it has been a life style change for both my physical and mental wellbeing. Thank you so much Amanda for everything over the last 8 weeks . #nevergiveup

.
.
I am a huge fan of plant based diets. I am not vegetarian but I try to get a large amount of plants into my diet. It was often thought that vegetarians don't get enough protein in their diet. Vegetarians can get a sufficient amount of protein in their diet with good meal planning and preparation. But eliminating any part of your diet can come with trade offs so it is important there is a conscious effort to add protein to all meals. There is also risk of deficiencies such as iron and Vitamin B12 so air on the side of caution⚠️⚠️⚠️

Sometimes I think people (myself included) give all this 'great' information on macronutrients and some people don't even know what a 'carb' source is 🙈
.
.
This is a great diagram to show what foods contain what. Some foods are primarily single nutrient based while others contain more than one.
.
.
I use this a lot when I talk about carb or calorie cycling. I also use it in relation to trying to keep treat meals within your goals.
E.G If going out for a meal but weight loss is a goal and you don't want to absolutely ruin all progress. I would recommend to a client stick to either a protein/fat OR protein/cárb meal. Yes, it comes down to overall calories but it's much easier to overeat on a protein/fat/carb meal like a lasagne and chips than a steak and veg or a stir fry with rice 🤔
.
.
Hope this helps clear up some things for people 😃

Cute I know ❤️
.
.
I have learned so much in that 5 years. I have educated myself so much more. I have made mistakes which I've learned from. I tried some silly things and failed. But also tried some crazy things and succeeded 🙌 My page is a reflection of what I do, it always has been. It was started to keep me accountable 🙈😂 If I didn't have thousands of bloody posts I'd definitely be looking back cringing 😂🙈 As you get older, you do learn, you do get some Sense, you do find yourself. 👌
.
.
5 years ago the girl writing posts on this page was: Insecure, searching for abs, weaker - physically & mentally and enjoying exercise but also punishing herself for a binge the odd time
.
.
Now, this girl is: Confident, enjoys every time she exercises (no punishment workouts required), body composition is not my goal (although my body is in great shape, it is as a result of training hard, it's not my priority, its as a by product) and I am so proud of what my body is capable of ❤️
.
.
Love your body. Love what your body is capable of. Stop searching for aesthetic goals. Start focusing on performance. Embrace everything your body CAN do. Nourish your body. You're going to be in it your whole life, you might aswell start looking after it 🙌🙌🙌

Fail to prepare, prepare to fail ☢️☢️☢️
.
.
We all have the same 24 hours in the day. Yes, it's very easy to be 'too busy' to prepare and cook food. A takeaway or a deli are very appealing after a long day of work. But it comes down to habit. If you form a habit, this becomes a lot easier.
If you keep putting it on the back burner it becomes harder. 🙄
.
.
My top tips to Food Prep:
- Do a weekly food shop - Having good foods in the house make it easier. If you have no food in your fridge it's much easier to pick up convenience crap. Do a full shop at the start of the week and you're off to a great start😉 The above ingredients are the basis of my food shop every week 📃
.
- Pick a day. Take an hour and get prepping. I do a Sunday evening. I put a batch of chicken, fish and turkey burgers in the oven to last me 3 days. While they are cooking, I boil broccoli and make up a salad. I chop up my fruit and portion out my Greek yogurt. I put my overnight oats in the fridge for the next day. It take me and hour to get the bulk of my food ready for 3 days. I use microwaveable rice to save time too. I save money because I rarely eat out and make all my own lunches. I do the same on a Wednesday evening. Tupperware is your new best friend. .
- Find food you like and stick with it. It's actually very simple. People overcomplicate it. It's unnecessary.
.
- If you do have to eat out or buy lunch there are LOADS of healthy options. Stop saying there's none. Go to Aldi, buy a bag of spinach, hot smoked salmon and a pot of cous cous (portion out). That's 2 lunches. Stop using excuses
.
- Get into a routine. I am in such a routine now that even when I go off course like have a few drinks at the weekend, I am back to Tupperware on Monday. Its ALL ABOUT HABITS 👌
.
.
Let me know some of your food prep ideas 🤔 Mine are pretty monotonous. It's really just about forming a habit and sticking to it 👌

23,2019-09-01T17:45:10+0000,"Searching for motivation 🔎🔎🔎
.
.
Most people think motivation should come naturally and then you'll form a habit. When in fact it's the other way around. Motivation is a result of habits formed. You don't just wake up one day and say that's it, I'm gonna be motivated for good 😏 It just doesn't happen like that. Your habits create motivation. People always ask me how am I so motivated all the time 🤔
.
.
Firstly, know that I am not motivated all the time. No one is. But training regularly and eating healthy are both habits to me. I don't go through periods of eating well and exercising. I do it regularly and consistently. How are some people so 'motivated' to go out every weekend? Habit..What about people who play football every weekend? Habit (they also have responsibility to a coach and a team) which brings me onto my next point.
.
.
I advise getting a coach. Someone who holds you accountable. It's not always easy at the start. It can take a long time to form a habit. Having a coach there, helps you from quitting when you want to(and there will be times you want to)
.
.
Stop focusing on the end goal and start enjoying the ride 🚲 This one I can't emphasise enough. Today was my first day off training in 13 days. I really really wanted to train (I love training) but it was more important to get a day out with my family. It should add to your life, not take away from it. Sometimes it will be priority, sometimes it won't but you need to incorporate it into your lifestyle and make time for it. ✌️
.
.
Remember, you are in control. You decide what you can and can't do. Goals are important. But stop focusing so much on an end point and enjoy the journey 👌Oh and find something you enjoy, that is vital. If you don't enjoy it, you won't sustain it 😔😖 #motivation #youareincontrol #takecontrol #goals #fitliving #fitlifestyle #fitness #eatforhealth #eatforperformance #fitfam #irishfitfam",151,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/68758593_304424250391942_6838941006800184285_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=vlQ418u72lIAX8K7RrD&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfDKhwnc8ESdcXdKXgyIgdVZZA2zL23pNAHtiXGYlfmBdg&oe=63D7E889,https://www.instagram.com/p/B14KBTdocjl/,17874938245442109,,,,
24,2019-08-31T10:03:02+0000,"Snack options 🤔
.
.
One of my most frequently asked questions 🤔 I feel like people want 1 million different options 😂 When they can actually build snacks simply around 1 food 😀
.
.
Option 1 : Tuna - can be eaten alone, can be mixed with cottage cheese, can be added to Corncakes, can be added to a green salad. There's 4 different snacks with just tuna
.
.
Option 2: Greek yogurt - add berries, add an orange, add grapes, add Choc shot, add granola, add nut butter... The list goes on.
.
.
Option 3: The old reliable. Apple and nut butter 😍 Be cautious of nut butter allowance 👌
.
.
Option 4: Nuts - again jam packed full of nutrients but be careful of portion size as these calories can accumulate
.
.
Option 5: Oatcakes/Corncakes/Ricecakes - Add a little nut butter, normal butter, cheese, Choc shot, fruit... The list is endless ✌️
.
.
Other options include: Fruit, Veg with hummus, boiled eggs, protein shakes, protein bars. There is a huge variety. If you like the odd treat opt for crisps or sweets with less than 100 Cals 😜
.
.
I'd love to know your GO TO snacks

0,2019-08-29T07:21:29+0000,"Weights can make you bulky 😬😬😬
.
.
OK, now I've got your attention. Let me explain to you 😝
.
.
2014 This was me: 9 stone of skin and bone, Active my whole life with a poor diet and a little pot belly 🐤😂 I had no upper body strength. I could not lift more than a 7kg bar overhead. Please don't use 'not being able to do a pull up' as a measure of upper body strength, they are damn bloody hard 😩 And A lot of super strong people can't do them.
.
.
Fast forward 5 years later. I am 10.5 stone with a heck of a lot of that muscle and a little chub 😉🐷 I eat to fuel my body and I still have my protruding stomach but it's leaner 😂😋
.
.
So why do I reckon I gained so much weight?
I genuinely think people look at me and think, ah she looked better before she started weight training. And that's fine. That's people's opinions and they are entitled to that. But I gained muscle. I added about 40kg to my overhead press and my legs and bum make up 3/4 of my weight I reckon 😂 But this doesn't just happen overnight and probably won't happen to many people. I train very regularly and consistently usually 5/6 times a week, sometimes twice a day. That sheer volume will of course increase muscle mass. And I eat to maintain.
.
.
If you train like me, and depending on your size and frame, there is a possibility you will gain weight. Your size 8 pants may jump to a size 10 😳😂 But chances are you don't train like me and if you did, you wouldn't be caring about a little weight gain 🤷‍♀️
. .
I can promise doing 3 45 min weight sessions a week will NOT make you 'bulky'. It will however:
☑️ Help you drop body fat
☑️ Improve your overall body composition, ☑️ Make you stronger,
☑️ Improve bone Density
☑️ Strengthen joints, tendons and ligaments
☑️ Make you happier and healthier

1,2019-08-24T12:08:03+0000,"This is probably one of my most honest posts I've EVER wrote. And that's saying something 🙈Because I'm pretty much an open book 📙 Some of you might agree with me. Most of you won't. It's an opinion that is all 😇
.
.
I lost my love of football about 3 years ago 💔💔💔
.
.
When I first started, skill was priority. Which I had none of 😂 But I still had the craic. It was so much fun. Even though I never got a game, the sidelines were hopping when I was around 🎶🎶🎶
Between the ages of 18 and 25, fitness was priority 🏃‍♀️Finally my lucky break 🙌 I may not be able to kick a ball, but I was fit 🙋💪 I enjoyed football so much during these years ❤️ And thankfully, they were my best years performance wise and I had a few medals to show for it too 🏅🏅🏅
.
.
But the last 3 years the game has changed. Or maybe it was just my mentality. I had sacrificed so much for so long, maybe I was just sick of doing that 🤔 Or maybe I just don't have the same winning mentality others have. 🤷‍♀️ I cannot do 'whatever it takes' to win. Its just not in me 🚫 And as for sacrifice. It used to be a 2 week drinking ban which has now turned into: No holidays, no alcohol for months, no social life, strain on relationships/friendships.
.
.
So why do you still do it?
The girls ❤️ The friends you make and the relationships you build make it all worthwhile. That being said I am done at intercounty level. I want to enjoy engagements, weddings, and 30ths. I've had my time. I've lost a lot more than I've won, but I'm happy to call quits on my inter County career now. I don't get the same thrill as I used to. I'm slowing down and I'm enjoying other things more (club and crossfit) 💪
.
.
Thanks to all the amazing people I've met along the way. All the people who've injured me. All the people I've injured. All part of the journey. .

.
.
No matter what it's in relation to. Whether it's fitness, lifestyle, new foods, meeting new people, changing career, moving, education... The list goes on 📃 Great things happen in your growth and learning zone 👌
.
.
I'm normally pretty good for veering outside my comfort zone. I'm constantly pushing myself fitness wise. I'm always trying to further my education and knowledge. I'm great for trying new foods and visiting new places 🏖️
.
.
But this pushed me out of my comfort zone. Firstly, the idea of photos alone makes my skin Crawl (selfies don't count, there's just something different🙈). Secondly, I am OCD about organisation. So when I had to get these photos unorganised I freaked 😬😬😬 It was a Friday morning. I had been up since 5 and forgot Gym gear, make up and to brush me hair 😭 I was pasty and had my period ☹️ I had a day to prepare for these pictures so needless to say there was no 'photoshoot prep' 😔😔😔 But I did it. And I didn't die of embarrassment 😂 I was actually pretty happy with the interview in the magazine (which the photos were for). It was absolutely fine 😂 It's great to get out of that comfort zone every once and everything worked out OK in the end 🙌 Thanks @michellehugheswalshphotography 😁 And today, I decided to sign up to a crossfit competition totally untrained 😂

3,2019-08-22T08:26:42+0000,"Is brown or basmati rice better? 🤔
.
.
Another nutrition answer that people don't like to hear but it depends 🙈😂 (Anwser to almost every nutrition related question😂). Well that's mainly because there are no 'good' or 'bad' foods and that question is too generic.
.
.
Picture 2 gives a nutritional break down of basmati rice while picture 3 is Brown rice's nutrition composition. Calories from basmati rice are slightly higher than brown rice while the protein content is also slightly higher. Brown rice is slightly higher in fat. Both have similar fibre content and both have a medium GI.
.
.
So really as you can see there is no dramatic nutritional difference between both grains. Basmati Rice may be slightly easier to digest than brown rice but that varies from person to person. I personally recommend variety. I also recommend convenience and what fits into your lifestyle (personally boiling brown rice for 30 mins doesn't fit into my lifestyle and a microwave basmati is much more convenient). I wouldn't fret over which one is 'better' but rather have both. Also, if you're picking either over chips you're doing something right 🙌🙏 #nutrition #nutritionfacts #realnutrition #realfood #alwayslearning #healthyliving #healthylifestyle #fitliving #fitlifestyle #fitfam #irishfitfam",53,0,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/67080053_501676667266023_4571944300062028533_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=IYLq8n3TMXwAX8SbFI5&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfAZsW5gIYw69D_YDF8LBNos7Pib0YohCsEGF4TKkWZKWw&oe=63D8ADD4,https://www.instagram.com/p/B1daKPuobWR/,18091559521016800,,,,

Testimonial (this client was from a few months back) 
I was looking for some inspiration after putting on weight over the Christmas period. I was going to classes in my local gym but wasn’t seeing any results. I found the classes over packed and generally followed the same format for weeks. I was motivated to go to the gym I just needed a plan. I have followed Amanda’s page for a number of years and decided to get in touch and I’m so glad I did!! Amanda prepared a structured food plan and gym programme tailored to me. I found myself getting more confident in the gym and increasing weights as the weeks went by. I found I had more energy and generally felt better about what I was eating. The food plan is flexible and achievable. I managed to navigate two hens and learnt about the balance between socialising and staying on track with the plan. Amanda was always there with a helpful text or phone call. I couldn’t recommend the plan more! Thanks Amanda!! 💪🏼 #onlineclient #realresults #realnutrition #nocuttingcorners #sustainableliving",94,1,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/69367632_375234073149180_1620133991917215623_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=VjYfX3U2Ft4AX8NTfxo&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfDCMTBD2zxvTP2IqRCirvAJVJ1_8azW0z9LJdZO5SBsvw&oe=63D82FE0,https://www.instagram.com/p/B1a5cXLoSid/,18013293079232839,,"[{'timestamp': '2019-08-21T09:46:23+0000', 'text': '👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼', 'username': 'katiehiggins92', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '18073861042105989'}]",,

.
.
Here's my story:
I stressed so much over that bloody Leaving Cert. My hair fell out. I looked like a skeleton. And we won't even get started on my face make up less 😂 And for what 🤷‍♀️ I ended up with a great Leaving Cert. Got the course I wanted 💯❤️ Studied in UCD for 4 years it was all fantastic 😀 Until I got out of college, there were no jobs. I went back to the job I worked in throughout school and college. 🔙 After a year, I decided I needed to use my Nutrition degree and with the lack of the jobs in the area I decided to go into personal training and fitness instruction 💡💡💡
The course was fantastic. I was delighted with it. It was a full time course so I was on the dole. I finished it and was all set to start my career when.... I tore my ACL. Bear in mind I had not been working prior to this and with course fees I was pretty much broke 😩 So €7000 worth of surgery, scans and doctors appointments later. I was now an unfit, useless personal trainer with debt up to my eyeballs 😬
.
.
5 years later... I'm doing pretty alright. I'm in a job and career I absolutely ADORE. I've had a few magazine and news paper articles. I've been an ambassador and role model. I've worked with successful teams and its only going to get better. I'm still building on my knowledge. 10 years after sitting my leaving cert I'm finally settled. Will I be in this industry forever? 🤔 I don't know. It took me a long enough to get here so I'm just going to enjoy the ride. 🚲 There are ways to achieve your career. Long roads🚜 Short Paths🚴 But you can and will get there with a little determination 💯❤️ #leavingcert #lifegoeson #dontletapieceofpaperdefineyourlife",260,2,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/62527708_465764067488506_3340738293341230564_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=rp8ZxvkgP8UAX8A1KhM&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfDIEvYwSa1_uzNFHnios30km0_Ju5BrQKgIWEYsSUZT4Q&oe=63D8DF30,https://www.instagram.com/p/B1GDBlDoSzy/,17914430704323752,,"[{'timestamp': '2019-08-14T07:54:56+0000', 'text': '❤️', 'username': 'konradstarostka', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '18072687109118328'}, {'timestamp': '2019-08-13T13:18:53+0000', 'text': 'Brill post Amanda 👌 ❤️', 'username': 'fitzy2218', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '18012284005232601'}]",,

10,2019-08-09T14:38:08+0000,"What is iron and why is it important?
.
. 
Iron is an essential mineral needed by the body. Its primary function is to transport oxygen in the haemoglobin of red blood cells so the cells can produce energy. It also helps to remove carbon dioxide.
. 
How much iron do you need and where do we get it?
.
. 
Infants and toddlers need more iron than adults because their bodies are still growing. Women need more iron than men due to menstruation. Women require about 18mg/day while men need just 8mg/day. Iron is found in foods like: Shellfish, Liver, Red Meat, Spinach, Kale and Fortified Cereals. Haem Iron is the iron we get from animal sources and is most easily absorbed in the body. Non haem iron comes from plant sources and is not as easily absorbed so may require supplementation in vegetarians and vegans. Vitamin C is also essential for Iron absorption. It’s found in many fruits like Blackcurrants, strawberries, kiwis and oranges. Adding orange juice or fruit to an iron rich meal can help absorption.
.
. 
How do I know if I’m deficient in Iron?
.
. 
Common symptoms of Iron deficiency anaemia include: Fatigue, Paleness, Difficulty exercising, or have a fast heartbeat. It is important to never self diagnose. Too much iron is toxic and should not be taken unless recommended by a medical professional.
.
. 
Female athletes are at risk of iron deficiency anaemia due to menstruation and high exercise output. Make sure if you are showing any of the symptoms to get it checked out by a doctor and never self diagnose.

.
.
I'm a big fan of variety but a hectic schedule means it's often pretty hard to plan and make all the food I'd like to make 🙈 I'm a fan of making my own food and try to avoid convenience options as best as possible, but its sometimes unavoidable 🤷‍♀️
.
.
Cous cous is cheap and one of the quickest grains to make and can be super tasty if made well. Cous cous is lower in calories than most grains. But also lower in fibre. I have added chickpeas to the cous cous which lowers it's overall GI and increases it's fibre content 👌 I've also added vegetables, well because, health ❤️🙏
.
.
Ingredients:
- 200g Cous cous
- Curry powder
- Vegetable stock
- Paprika
- Chilli Powder
- Garlic
- Peppers
- Onions
-Chickpeas

Make up the cous cous with water (as instructed on pack). Add all spices. Wait 5 mins and add vegetables and chickpeas. *Mixture shouldn't be soggy

Enjoy 👌

15,2019-07-31T17:19:49+0000,"Is Sleep really that important?
You’ve heard people say it’s important. That you need 8-10 hours per night. That without it you can’t function. But is there any real evidence to support everyone’s advice.
HELL YES!!!!
1.	Performance:
We’ve all heard, ‘Performance will suffer’. Recent studies have suggested that poor sleep is related to slower reaction times, compromised physical performance, increased risk of illness and injury, lower mood and decreased ability to learn and remember new skills. Poor sleep has been reported in elite athletes in numerous sports such as swimming, rugby, cricket, ice hockey and track and field. This is thought to be related to training times, competition stress/anxiety, muscle soreness, caffeine use, technology and travel. We found almost half (47.8 per cent) of GAA players monitored in a current study were poor sleepers, and those who were poor sleepers had significantly lower general health, increased stress and lower mood. 
Recent studies have found that: In a study of sleep interventions on athletes, sleep extension proved most beneficial to athletes. (1) Bonnar et al 2018. Another study claimed that increased sleep time improved sustained contraction time to exhaustions (2) Arnal et al. Meanwhile,  Inadequate sleep impairs maximal muscle strength in compound movements when performed without specific interventions designed to increase motivation. (3) Knowles et al

2.	Weight management
Short sleep duration and other aspects of poor sleep habits are growing in prevalence in modern society in both children and adults. A growing literature has established that short sleep duration and other dimensions of poor sleep are associated with obesity and appear to predict obesity risk and rate of weight gain longitudinally. Small experimental studies suggest poor sleep may impact dietary intake particularly hedonic eating. (4)  Ogilvie et al

3.	General Health 
A recent study showed that insufficient sleep and sleep disorders are highly prevalent and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Primary outcomes of insufficient sleep and/or sleep disorders are weight gain and obesity.

.
.
Body Fat Percentage Norms
>32% Overweight/Obese
25-31% Normal
21-24% Fit
13-20% Athlete
10-12% Essential
.
. 
So apart from those genetically gifted people, being lean/athletic and remaining lean requires effort. Effort that a lot of people aren't willing to give. Time people aren't willing to put into it. And sacrifices people aren't willing to give up 🙈 I see it all the time. People with unrealistic goals. 😬
.
.
I (am not this lean right now) and a lot of GAA players are lean year round. Why?
Training 5-6 times a week, healthy eating to fuel our bodies and adequate recovery. We also have to give up on a lot of social occasions and probably drink much less than peers. It's a consistent process and has been for years.
.
.
But what about when people become too obsessed with body fat?
😬😬😬
- If your body fat is > 32% for a female, it is optimal for overall health to try and reduce this. But if your body fat is at 20% unless you are competing or need to make weight for sport, you don't need to be actively seeking to reduce this.
- Remember, females need more essential fat than men at about 12%. This is for our overall reproductive health. With low body fat, there is an increased risk in amenorrhoea (loss of period). This is due to the pituitary gland reducing production of hormones. This can have long term implications and can result in potential loss of reproductive function
- Other problems associated with a very low body fat can include: decreased bone mass density, problems with your heart, shrinkage of your organs, loss of muscle tissue, stomach problems and nervous system damage.
.
.
Please think of the long term implications of actively seeking a very low body fat. It may not affect you now if you are young, but down the road the health implications are daunting.

.
So firstly, this is a cop out for a lot of people. Some people genuinely don't know what busy means and they use this as an excuse 😏😏😏 I've seen it all. I've had people tell me they can't eat well because they are 'too busy'. Why I asked? I work 10-5 and don't get a break. OK so what about the hours before 10 and after 5 🤔
I have seen the other end of the scale. I work with a lot of nurses who MAKE time. Even after their 12 hour night shifts. Even with children and a husband. So a lot of the time thís IS a choice. Personally, I have to prepare food and training gear up to 3 days in advance due to long days. .
.
But I have met others who it genuinely isn't. And eating on the road is the only option. If that is the case can you eat healthy?
✔️ Of course. The range of food choices has become so much better. There are healthy options available most places if you are looking for them.
👉 A lot of salad bowls are available in fridges. Greek yogurt is a great go to snack. Little pots of berries are often found along side them
👉 Fruit is never far away in most shops
👉 If you want something warm why not get soup and add chicken to it?
👉 Pre packaged foods like rice and lentils are always available if you have a microwave at work
👉 You can even get healthier options in fast food outlets. Wraps and Healthy Ciabattas are now available in most of them.
.
.
❌ You don't need to go for that carvery dinner every day. That is a choice.
❌ You can choose a healthier option in the deli, you just choose not to
❌ Being busy is NO excuse to have curry chips for lunch

Health benefits to resistance training
☑️ Increases bone density and strengthens joints - This is of particular importance as we get older. There is no age limit on resistance training. We should start young and continue it regularly throughout our lives ☑️ Increases lean muscle mass - Optimal body composition. Studies suggest that a combination of resistance and cardiovascular training is more beneficial for weight loss than either in isolation

Other benefits to resistance training
✔️ You get stronger 💪
✔️ Boosts body confidence 👙
✔️ Reduce body fat mass and increase muscle mass = Shape the body you want

23,2019-07-14T15:21:46+0000,"Listen up, this one is important. You don't want to fall down on this one 😜🤣 (I craic myself up😆🙈)
.
.
But honestly, it's the peak of championship, priority to every sports person out there should be performance 💪💪💪 If your goal is aesthetics, you're in sport for the WRONG reason 🙈🤔
.
.
So what does that all mean?
- Firstly, you need to be eating to fuel your performance. Large calorie deficits should be a thing of pre season, not mid season. (Now a slight calorie deficit may be OK, but I still would not be recommending it for clients). Food is so important. Stocking up on carbs, an abundance of protein and lots of healthy fats 👌 If you are lean this time of year, it should be as a result of lots of training, not lots of dieting.  I personally am sitting at about 22% Body Fat. That's probably more than my regular BF % but I am eating in maintenance and maybe even a little bit of a surplus just to be sure I am getting enough fuel 👌 This weekend I had 2 games. It's not the first time and it won't be the last. I've trained 6 times this week and it's so important to get the most out of your body on game day 👌 - Secondly, it goes back to my burnout post. You need to fuel ✔️ But you seriously need to recover. I'm starting to take up a pool session a week to aid with my recovery. I am in an ice bath almost every day and I see a chiropractor every  4-6 weeks. Now is not the time of year to be hitting PBs in the gym 😬 The gym shouldnt get shoved out the window but maintenance should be all you should be looking for right now 👍
.

.
. 
People still seem to be afraid to talk about this topic 🙈 It's such a natural thing which all us ladies have to deal with so I'm so glad someone asked me to talk on this topic 😊
.
.
Let's be honest none of us WANT to do it, especially if you are crippled with period pains 😩 And there's a lot of non sense out there telling us we 'shouldn't' do this that and the other 🤔 So what is the truth?
.
.
Well firstly like with most things I talk about it is very individual dependent. If you have a low iron count or anaemia, this time of month is very difficult to exercise. You are an exception to the norm. But for most of us there's no need to cut out exercise. Sometimes we MAY just need to cut down especially if you have a heavy flow and are losing a lot of blood 😔
.
.
Why should we exercise during our period?
✔️ Decreases PMS symptoms
✔️ Endorphins - our feel good factor
✔️ Reduces period pains
✔️ Enhances your mood 😊
.
.
What type of exercise should we do?
-As I said before, most of the time we can just keep up with our normal exercise routine but yoga and pilates can be quite beneficial.
- Did you know that during your period you're stronger? So low rep strength training can be benificial 💪
.

.
.
Every year around this time of year, someone on your team is likely to suffer from burnout 😔 A recent survey done with intercounty minors showed that 62% of underage players played while carrying injuries and 42% experienced chronic fatigue 😳
.
.
The GAA calendar year is long. For some of us it doesn't stop. You need to know how to adapt and tailor training to different cycles during the year. If you're lucky enough to have a great coach, they will be able to do this for you, if not, you need to seek help. The same level of training cannot be continued year long. Everybody needs periods of Deload especially athletes 👌
.
.
I train year long. I don't take long breaks. And I know my body craves and needs it. I try to Deload but I'm not the best at listening to my own advice. Until this year 💡 Other people would think I'm mad taking a rest period before championship starts but thats exactly what my body needed ❤️ I normally train 5/6 times a week but with reducing my training by 1 or 2 days a week for June, my body thanked me and my energy levels are exactly where they need to be this time of year 😊 I have also had to step away from my beloved Crossfit the weeks of championship games 😭 As football is priority at the moment. But for once I'm listening to my body and performance is the main goal 👌 Maybe you should too? 👂👂👂 #champo #championship #burnout #praticewhatyoupreach #fitliving #fitlife #fitlifestyle #eatforhealth #eatforperformance #fitfam #irishfitfam",268,14,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/65304887_460088841453711_8943344036927958456_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=1GeZ0KLdQ5YAX9gR1W-&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfDp2bN8Py5uTp4pQpyRC1wJTDc4JDk02q9kYFNRAtepTQ&oe=63D94021,https://www.instagram.com/p/Bzs_pX8orGI/,18013500715223308,,"[{'timestamp': '2019-07-09T22:34:06+0000', 'text': 'Love this look ❤️', 'username': 'dympnamullally', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2019-07-10T07:22:35+0000', 'text': '@dympnamullally thanks x', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '18003758446234045'}]}, 'id': '18053791903185684'}, {'timestamp': '2019-07-09T20:17:55+0000', 'text': '🔥 🔥🔥', 'username': 'jackieglennon', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '17848447237498114'}, {'timestamp': '2019-07-09T17:44:08+0000', 'text': '💕💕💕those jeans 🙌🏻🙌🏻👌(also looking fab)', 'username': 'lackenlady', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2019-07-09T17:57:17+0000', 'text': '@lackenlady thanks gal x', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '17875449025401772'}]}, 'id': '17852363284471693'}, {'timestamp': '2019-07-09T17:30:31+0000', 'text': ""That's great advice.

2,2019-07-03T22:09:40+0000,"Do We Need Breakfast?
.
. 
Well firstly it’s a myth that anyone ‘needs’ breakfast. 
But we were always told that breakfast is the most important meal of the day?
If you questioned why. You were probably told because your metabolism starts when you eat breakfast. If you have breakfast, your metabolism starts earlier. And probably that you burn more calories if you eat breakfast or ‘you’ll lose weight’ eating breakfast. Well according to Betts et al 2014 [1] Daily Breakfast consumption has no effect on resting metabolism. For those of you who hate breakfast or those of you who like to fast, there is hope 😁 Does that mean don’t eat breakfast? Absolutely not. I’m a regular breakfast eater. I could not go without it. But I deal with clients daily who ‘Don’t have time’ or ‘can’t stomach it’ so I won’t force them to consume it. The answer really is do you want breakfast, if no, don’t eat it, if yes, enjoy 😊  You may have also been told the more meals you have in a day equates to burning more calories and boosts your metabolism more. 
This is also a myth. The thermic effect of food is the same if you have 6 meals or 2 meals. Sometimes having small frequent meals can actually prove a hindrance as you may overconsume on calories. Dashti et al. 2017 [2]. Your metabolism or metabolic rate is highly influenced by your overall calorie consumption, your food choices, your NEAT and your purposeful exercise. It is overall daily calorie intake that is what matters, not necessarily how you distribute it. Unless in certain circumstances like athletic performance or muscle retention, where it may be important. 
So finally, it really comes down to personal preference. Do what suits you and your lifestyle. Remember, when it comes to metabolic rate, overall calories are important. What is not important is meal timing or meal frequency. 😊

Testimonial: 
After a few years of struggling to lose weight I was getting nowhere. I seen Amanda’s programme on her instagram page and straight away I was interested and thought it would really help me get on the right track. Amanda gave me a meal plan and workouts to do at home which was great as I could do the workouts when it suited me. A few weeks into the program my energy levels increased & I starting feeling and seeing the benefits of the programme. Amanda checked in with me every week with phone calls or voice tags. I am so happy with the end result and thoroughly enjoyed it, I can’t thank Amanda enough and would highly recommend her online programme. Thanks so much Amanda

Do you want to cool off with a nice cool, refreshing ice lolly but feel it'll ruin all chances of you reaching your goals 🙈 Fear not 🍦🍦🍦 Ice lollies are usually the best option calorie wise as they contain a lot of water and very little cream and extra fat. Above I have named afew options under 100 Cals.

This is one that gets on my wick 🙈
Firstly, I don't want the f*#cking donut Susan, it's none of your business as to why. I just don't feel I need to eat a sugar and fat laden food at 10am that is going to make my stomach churn. There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with eating the donut, unless you are guilted into it. Everyone has their own goals, and if you don't to eat/do something you're under no obligation to explain yourself. If people don't respect your decision well they can go 🖕 Same goes for drinking. If you aren't drinking you're either pregnant or on antibiotics, people can't seem to accept 'I'm just not drinking as an excuse' 🙈 Worry more about yourself, and not what others are doing 👌
.
.
Secondly, yes you are human. Even as a nutritionist I enjoy crisps with my friends or I might opt for a dessert. And when I'm on holiday 😂 I go all out 😜Just because I eat very healthy majority of the time doesn't mean I don't enjoy normal meals out and a few drinks 😁 So please don't say 'Omg I didn't think you'd eat that😒'.
.
.
Choosing health is a choice made by a lot of people. Sometimes it's a hard decision and is forced upon them by health issues or illness. Some people struggle with it, others enjoy it.

.
.
✔️Its OK to go on a holiday.
✔️It's OK to take a little break(physically and mentally)
Even if it is in the middle of championship 🏐🏐🏐
.
.
I feel like sometimes people forget this is a hobby. You're not paid. You don't get that much recognition. And yet you're expected to act like an elite athlete.
.
.
For me:
Holidays are a necessity. I work my normal 40 hours. I have my online clients which probably bring my working week up to 60 hours. I drive 1.5-3hrs daily. I rise at 5am at least 3 times a week and am in bed every night at 11 because of either work or training. I do something every weekend because I like to keep busy. And that's before training. I train 4 times a week with football and 1/2 of my own sessions. ✔️That's who I am and I like being super busy.
.
. 
Holidays give me time to relax and unwind and without them I would never do that.
I used to be that person who sacrificed everything to play football. I still sacrifice a lot, you have to. But I was sacrificing my happiness and probably a little bit of my health.
.
.
I structure it that I don't miss any games and I always feel so mentally refreshed coming back onto the pitch so I think it's a win win 😁 I know a lot of coaches may not like this post but remember it's you as the player who is the most important and valuable asset to a team. 👌

19,2019-06-05T16:52:50+0000,"Fat gets a bad rep. Sure it is 9Kcal per gram but it is an essential part of a balanced fat. Fats provide us with energy, makes up our cell membranes as well as our brain and nervous system. Fats are necessary to transport vitamins A,D,E and K and make and balance certain hormones. Fat can be found in 2 forms:
Saturated – mainly found in animal products like meat, dairy, eggs, coconut
Unsaturated – found in marine sources like fish oils, as well as nuts, seeds and vegetable oils
.
. 
For years saturated fat was thought to be associated with higher risk of Cardiovascular Disease and so it was deemed as ‘unhealthy’ or ‘bad for you’. The problem with saturated fat was not the actual fat itself but rather the increased consumption of processed food or the large quantities of saturated fat products. Saturated fat helps increase the cholesterol production in the body which is an essential part of metabolism and in the production of steroid hormones. So saturated fat should feature in our diet, just maybe don’t latter every meal in butter.
.
. 
Unsaturated fats are made up of mono and polyunsaturated fats.  These contain our omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids. Omega 3 fatty acids open our airways and blood vessels. They reduce our blood lipids and cholesterol and lower inflammation and pain. Omega 6 fatty acids do the opposite. Both are needed in the body, without both we wouldn’t heal or recover from exercise. The problem with Western diets is that we don’t have the proper ratios. We are at about 10:1 where we should be at 2:1 (omega 6/omega 3).
.
. 
Low fat diets were a fad a few years ago. While people reduced calories, they increased their intake of processed foods. Diets lacked fats and fat soluble vitamins so instead of being healthier people were losing weight but were not healthier.
.
. 
Fats are an essential part of any healthy diet. Be aware that they are very calorie dense so be sure not to overconsume and don’t opt for processed versions. Enjoy them as part of a balanced lifestyle.

21,2019-05-30T12:52:57+0000,"Once upon a time I was obsessed with having abs and glutes. I was so obsessed I would take daily photos of myself. Hoping and praying I'd look different 🙏 I would eat in a bid for those abs. I ate really clean and I'd end up on a chocolate binge at Weekends and I was so upset with not having the body I always wanted😭😭
.
.
When my Dad died, my whole outlook on life changed. Health became a priority to me and abs no longer seemed so important. As soon as I started caring more about my health, I started to enjoy my training a lot more 😍 I was still eating very well but I wasn't obsessing about 'bad food'.
.
.
Fast forward 3 years later and I am so incredibly proud of my body. Not for what it looks like but for what it can do ❤️ And the irony of it is, I'm probably in the best shape of my life as result.

Life is so much more important than micro managing every morsel of food you eat and punishing yourself for eating 'bad food'.

While a pink gin and slimline tonic comes in at about 70 calories, it's convenient can option is a very different kettle of fish 🙊 Again, alcohol is empty calories but if you are drinking these cans thinking you're going for the 'good option', 5 of these cans will set you back almost 1000 Calories (and let's be honest they are easy to drink 😜).

West Coast Cooler is a lower calorie option (calories based on same volume) and I personally think just as tasty 🤭

23,2019-05-28T07:28:17+0000,"How to get a bikini body.
Step 1. Put on a bikini. 👙
.
. 
While I wish it were that simple for everyone to be that confident. Not everyone is. Truth is every single woman out there has insecurities 😭 Myself included. I'd be pretty comfortable in a bikini year round but there are tips I recommend to make you feel good whilst on holidays ☀️
.
.
Like most I enjoy myself on holidays. I drink, I eat rich food and I exercise less. All these differences to my lifestyle and add in the fact that I have a sensitive stomach can cause a lot of bloating and water retention. 🐋 I try to keep this at bay as best as possible so I feel confident in my bikini 👌
.
. 
1. Drink as much water as possible. Alcohol plus salty food can equal a lot of fluid retention so it's important to get guzzling that water. Not to mention the other side effects of dehydration like headaches and vomiting. Nobody wants that on holidays. I also bring electrolytes and dandelion Root with me.
.
.
2. Do a little exercise. While I take a break from my heavy 5-6 day routine I like to get a session in every 2-3 days. If you're not interested in the gym when away nó problem. Why not go for a run or cycle? And walk EVERYWHERE 👌
.
.
3. Don't take the piss. If you want to eat like an absolute fool, do, but don't complain about the stomach cramps or diarrhoea. 🤷‍♀️ If I'm going to Indulge in a heavy meal for dinner, I'll have a decent breakfast or vice versa. Keep protein with every meal and reduce snacking if it's leading to a massive consumption in calories. .
.
4. Don't drink all your calories. Cocktails are great 🍹 But don't forget they contain calories too, so does the 3 fantas a day and your baileys coffee after dinner 🙊 Again, I suffer if I eat a lot of sugar so I know not to over consume on these, but some of you might need some reminding 🤣😵
.
.
It's not all doom and gloom. You won't ruin all your progress if you do decide to go all out. I just know some of you suffer with the same symptoms as me and hopefully this might help you 😊

I cannot recommend amanda’s services enough! I have been heavily involved with team sports from a young age so I never really had to think about a exercise routine per say, so when I started traveling and hung up the boots it took awhile for me to realize that I had little to no exercise routine or healthy eating plan. I was completely stuck in a negative eating habit and it took a massive toll on my body and mind. 
When I eventually committed myself to Amanda's programme I felt like i was in control again. The biggest thing for me was accountablity, I knew what I needed to do to get back into shape but lacked the motivation to hold myself accountable. Amanda’s continuous check in’s and updated programmes made it so much easier to get back into routine and finally getting back to being comfortable and happy in my body.

Amanda is ridiculously knowledgeable, energetic, realistic, professional and inspirational. I could go on and on about how good this experience and process has been, if your lucky enough to have a chance to work with Amanda absolutely do it!! If you want a positive change in your physical and mental health she is your girl!

Testimonial:

Was really struggling post surgery to get back into going to the gym and training and I always put weight on easily but struggle to loose it. Seen amandas posts on social media and knew she wasn't trying a one size quick fix fits all. Although the scales haven't changed hugely over my 8 weeks I am really starting to see the difference in my body shape. Performance is massively improving also and I've found I'm back in a healthy relationship with food and not going through a continual starving then binging of certain food groups. Can't thank Amanda enough for everything.

Client Testimonial:
I came back from over a month of travelling and needed some accountability and direction to get me back on track after. I had been following Amanda's content on Instagram for a while so I knew she knew what she was talking about. The 8 week program was tailored to suit my schedule and the amount of time I knew I could commit to the gym.  Every week there was check-ins (phone calls/voice tags) to see how I was getting on. Amanda even tailored my program to take into account a big race that I ended up training for half way through the 8 weeks. The diet plan was easy for me because it had all the foods I would have  normally eaten so I enjoyed it. If I did have a bump in the road, like a big weekend of food and alcohol, Amanda never made me feel bad about it and recognised that these things happen. She assured me that I'd be back on track in no time again, which vanished the guilt and kept me motivated. Very happy with my results and I am now back to where I wanted to be 🙂

3,2019-05-19T07:48:39+0000,"I am not an s&c coach so I won't be giving advice on the different phases and cycles you should have in the gym. Although I have a very good idea it's not my area of expertise so I'll leave that to the experts 👌👌👌
.
.
What I do know?
- Resistance training is essential to reduce injury risk. Doing it pre season is not enough. You need to dedicate at least one day a week to it. The game speed and strength has dramatically increased. So too has the injury count. We need to keep on top of our games.
.
.
But what if I'm sore for training/match?
- Doms predominantly occur from:
1. A break from training and ré introduction of weights. Best way to avoid this, don't take a week off and definitely don't take more than that 😕
2. A new stimulus - maybe a new programme with the introduction of new exercises. Don't start this the day before a game 😑
3. Under recovery - Not getting in sufficient food and water post exercise
.
.
What should I be doing then?
Again, this won't be too highly detailed. Not my area of expertise 👆
- Volume shouldn't be crazy high - Rep ranges should probably be lower with higher weights. There's no need for a 12 exercise, hypertrophic leg day in the middle of championship 😩😩
- Exercises that transfer over onto the pitch - Strength, Power and plyomteric exercises. NOT bicep curls 😂💪 LADS that one is aimed at ye 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
- If you're recovering from an injury, you need to keep up with individual rehab as well as what everyone else is doing 👌

Hope thís helps. I get ALOT of questions regarding this one, but I don't want to delve into territory that is not mine, I'll leave that to the experts 👍

.
👉 Travel - whatever opportunity you get do it. J1, family holiday, interailing, city breaks. Just GO!!!!! Single best decision I've ever made was to go to Thailand with my friends. I have never looked back since. And the bucket list is slowly filling ✔️✔️✔️
👉 Stop exercising for weight loss, start exercising for health. Your WHOLE outlook changes and my God it is AMAZING what our bodies can do ❤️ And for the love of God find something you enjoy 😢 If you hate spinning, stop spinning. If you'd rather yoga to the gym, that's fine. If dancing is your thing, dance the night away 💃🕺
👉 Stop stressing. WE ARE IN CONTROL!!!!! I wish I learned this one sooner. Stress is still something I struggle with but I'm getting better 👌😉 Life is so much brighter without the weight of the world on your shoulders 😭 I heard yesterday that 6 out of 10 Leaving certs have had a physical or mental ailment from the stress of the Leaving Cert 😮 Take it from someone who's hair started falling out during the L.C. It's not worth it 😑😑
👉 Drink less. Alcohol in my teens, early twenties was excessive, there is no 2 ways about it. To a point of almost a problem. I still drink. I'm still a light weight 😂🙊 But it's no longer a problem. I know I might sound like an old Granny but if you become a terrible person when you are drinking, is it really worth it? 🤔
👉 Eat more. Food is fuel. Food is healthy. It breaks my heart to hear of younger girls depriving themselves😭 Eating disorders, poor relationships with themselves and excessive exercise are all on the increase. Stop trying to look like girls on Instagram, the girls themselves don't even look like that 😭

.
. 
The humble spud got a very bad rep in the last couple of years and the reign of the sweet potato took over. All potato recipes were substituted with sweet potato and sweet potato fries were on every menu. What is the difference between the two tubers?
.
. 
When you compare 100g of each baked, there is very little difference calorie wise. Carbohydrate and fibre wise they are practically identical. The main nutritional difference would be the significantly higher vitamin A content in Sweet potato and the white potato contains more potassium. Both have a High GI when cooked. .
. 
So, if you are thinking you’re ‘healthier’ eating Sweet potato, remember there is place for both types of potato in your diet and both should be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet 😊

These buzz words do not automatically make a food healthy. The only person that NEEDS to eat gluten free is a coeliac. Now that being said a gluten free diet can simply be an elimination of processed wheat, barley, and rye based products. But there is no need to opt for gluten free products because you think they are healthier. They are often heavily processed and again are not necessary unless you are coeliac. Same goes for dairy free 🙄 As for Vegan, this is a new buzzword. Plant based should be a large part of every diet for all the micronutrients, water and phytonutrients it gives us 😍 But getting a 'vegan sausage roll' will not make you a health queen 😂 Remember, if weight loss is a goal, calories are king. So if you are choosing between a raw cacao, nut butter, hazelnut infused brownie (400 cals) and an Eton mess (200cals), the Eton mess is probably the better option for your dietary goals. It may not be refined Sugar free but it's lower in calories (not based on actual calories). Finally, my favourite, high protein label. Everything has protein in it now: bars, bread, even water 😂
.
.
Just keep it simple. Plant based fruit and vegetables with each meal and snack. If you eat meat, buy from a butchers or reliable source. Natural protein sources include a lot of dairy based products, meat, fish, eggs, and legumes. Natural wholegrains, and tubers for our carbohydrate sources. Natural oils rather than man-made products. It's not rocket science. Don't give into marketing strategies, a lot of the time it's 🐃💩 #labelling #marketing #eatforhealth #eatforperformance #eatforgoals #fitliving #fitlifestyle #fitfam #irishfitfam",45,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/58468499_142699003527825_8861781701948837044_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=XB4-AMWd4A0AX8eI8v6&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfClytIZyHSPh81lg3qDuHOnFxzEqcC-mqqfD2lpRyb_5Q&oe=63D7D7B8,https://www.instagram.com/p/BxZVXVsBL00/,17859651217397155,,,,

10,2019-05-02T16:06:42+0000,"What is Fibre and why is it important? 🤔 - Fibre comes in 2 different forms:soluble and insoluble. We can't digest these, but they have very important roles in the body especially within our gut.
.
.
Soluble fibre is found in fruit, oats, dried beans and peas, nuts, barley and chia.
.
.
Insoluble fibre is found vegetables, fruit and vegetable skins, seeds and nuts
.
.
☑️Fibre helps us feel fuller for longer
☑️Lowers our risk of Colon cancer
☑️ Speeds up digestion through our GI tract
☑️ Bulks up our stools
☑️ Lowers our blood lipids and Cholesterol
☑️Boost overall gut health

We need approximately 25-35g per day. In Ireland, we tend to not eat enough fibre and thus we can have issues with our gut health. Too much can cause digestive stress so it's important to get just the right amount👌

These sacrifices will include social occasions. Again, expect that. If it starts affecting other elements of your life, your job, relationships or your health, that's where you draw a line. Coming back to the fact that any sport is a hobby. Gaa is not paid, and the sacrifices do mimic a professional sport. So enjoy the sport. Remember that's why you are doing it. 🤔 Don't let it dictate your life.

Other days I barely have the energy to brush my hair 😂 Some days I am super motivated. Other days a walk is a struggle (Monday 🙊).

16,2019-04-18T08:15:25+0000,"What are the components to fitness and how do I get fitter? This can be a very scientific topic so I'm going to put it in as simple terms as possible 👌
.
.
Firstly, you need to push outside a comfort zone or a tolerance limit. Most people will stay in that. And while staying in that zone will keep you at the same fitness levels, its pushing outside it that will ultimately improve your fitness. Let's be brutally honest, we've all seen it, the fittest players getting fitter while the unfit players pull out of sessions. This may not actually be their fault either. With team sports, there are all fitness levels. While you try to push the fittest on the team, sometimes it's too much on the unfit players which leads to dropout. If playing team sports, runs/sprints should be staggered (fitter players have more to do). Bench players should also have extra to do so they don't fall behind starting players. There is no one size fits all and that's hard to do with team sports. (This is purely opinion)
.
.
You need to train in the right energy systems. You don't see a Sprinter constantly doing 5ks (which is an aerobic system), no you see them work in an anaerobic system. If they are sprinting, they are working their creatine phosphate system, if they are in the gym, they are using the same energy system. If you are a field sport player, you need a bit of both. You need to be able to access your anaerobic system for short sprints and your aerobic system for recovery. That's why your trainer should have you doing both fast, speed work and endurance work. If you are poor in either of those areas, you need to work on them 😁
.
.
Hydration and Nutrition. Never ever underestimate these powerful tools. We only train about 10% of our time. The other 90% is sleep, recovery and nutrition. What you put into your body has a huge impact on your fitness levels. I talked about food and the importance of it not just for fuel but for other essential bodily functions 👌
.
.
Recovery. In the form of food, hydration, sleep, and physical rest. Our bodies are smart. If you Constantly 'grinding', our bodies don't have time to adapt. They are in overdrive.

17,2019-04-16T08:03:52+0000,"People over complicate everything 🙀🙀
.
.
Nutrition is relatively simple. Not necessarily easy, but simple. Exercise is the same. Eat better, move more 😍
.
.
I have people coming to me, sprinting before they have even learned to walk. Yes, I've heard it all. I've had overweight/obese people give out to me about my food choices as they are not organic or may be genetically modified🤔 I've had people who lived on takeaways all of a sudden are now vegan. And don't even get me started on going gluten and lactose free 😫🙊 Guys, get your house in order. If you are over weight none of these extremes are necessary. If you cut back a little on treats, controlled portion size and ate more vegetables you could probably sort all your problems out. It may be a slower process but it's a consistent one. I'm not trying to be harsh. I'm actually trying to be nice and say it's more simple than you are making it 😫
.
.
As for exercise. Going from nothing to something is always a benefit. But make sure it's not just purposeful exercise. Increasing your steps daily will have a huge benefit on your Basal Metabolic rate. And as for the best exercise, that is the one you enjoy the most and can sustain. I know people that exercise that absolutely hate it and do it for the sake of it 😭 Exercise should be something you enjoy, not endure, so find one you like❤️. I would recommend some form of resistance training on top of it, as it's hugely beneficial for bone, ligament and tendon health as well as maintaining lean muscle mass.
.
.
So stop over complicating healthy eating and exercise. You don't need to be a gluten and lactose free vegan to be healthy, nor do you need to be a crossfit athlete. Get moving daily, stop treating yourself so often (you don't need it), reduce your portion size and increase your vegetable consumption.

19,2019-04-12T14:02:00+0000,"I'm not a physio and I won't be giving you a big list of exercises to do for ACL rehab. Also, every injury is so different and every individual is so specialised and specific I won't be giving a one size fits all approach, because there isn't one 🤔🤔🤔
.
.
What I will say is 2 things:
👉 Firstly, don't underestimate the influence of nutrition on the healing process. What you put in your body is as important as your rehab exercises. Never forget that. 👆👆👆
.
.
👉 Secondly, if and hopefully when you get back on the pitch. Just because you are back from injury does not mean you are healed. If you don't keep on top of your strength and rehab work, your chances of re injury is increasingly higher. Keep on top of your strength work. Not just your quads (most of us footballers are quad dominant which isn't helped by the fact that when we do leg work it's mostly quad dominant work) but hamstrings and glutes need attention. Glute exercises include: Hip Trusters, Hip Bridges and Band Work. Hamstrings need to do 2 things: Knee Flexion (exercises like leg curls, Nordics) and Hip Extension (RDL).

20,2019-04-10T08:38:32+0000,"One of the most common questions I get asked is about a pre match meal. Well let me tell you, pre Match fuel begins long before the pre match meal. 😃
.
.
As discussed in previous posts, carbohydrates are the main fuel source involved in GAA. We can store 80-100g in our liver and 300-600g in our muscles as glycogen. But as glucose is constantly being used as a fuel source it is constantly depleting therefore we need to top it up regularly.
.
.
Pre Match nutriton begins the day before a game. So if you play Sunday at 2pm. You should be topping glycogen stores from 2pm Saturday. I recommend a carbohydrate source with each meal like Cous cous for lunch, potatoes for dinner and oats for breakfast the following morning. Closer to game time, fruit is a great source of cárbohydrate. Protein is also essential. As athletes we are constantly in recovery mode for our next session so protein needs to be a part of our pre Match routine. Although it won't be used as fuel it is an important element for muscle repair etc.
.
.
Some don'ts the day of a game
❌❌❌ ❎ High fat foods are harder to break down in the body and may cause gastrointestinal upset so best to avoid large quantities of fat. Save them for afterwards when we need to reduce inflammation
❎ High fibre foods can also cause gastrointestinal issues and while fibre is a vital part of a healthy diet, its best to avoid large quantities before games
❎ Strong flavoured foods .
.
Some dos
✔️✔️✔️
☑️ Nutrient dense foods with a cárbohydrate and protein element
👉Oats with whey protein, Eggs and Toast, fruit salad with Greek Yogurt, Chicken and pasta, fish and potatoes
☑️ Don't forget about water. Hydration is a key pre Match ritual

Hope this helps 😃 Never change a routine the day of a game. Slowly make changes in the days leading up to a game 👌

Prior to beginning my 8 week program from Amanda I was very active, playing ladies football and training between 3/4 times a week. I felt frustrated as I wasn’t seeing any results so linking up with Amanda was the best decision I ever made. From the detailed diet plan and training program I began to see a big difference on and off the field. I began to lose body fat and gain lean muscle, feeling physically stronger in every aspect. Thanks to Amanda my confidence is soaring both on and off the field. She’s the upmost professional offering support with her check ins and if I have any questions. Without a doubt the best decision I ever made was to contact @cleanandleansportygirl and begin my fitness journey. I even like it so much I signed up to another 8weeks!

22,2019-04-06T08:02:59+0000,"Listen up, this one is an important one.👂
.
.
Yes macros are important. Carbohydrate is the main source of energy for most sports. Protein is essential for repair and recovery. Fats are anti inflammatory and necessary for fat soluble vitamin transport. Yes your macronutrients which convert into energy are fuel for the body.
.
.
But what about micronutrients, phytonutrients and zoo chemicals. These don't directly fuel us but they are also vital to the functioning of the human body. They are responsible for vital internal functions and without them our bodies would not be able to asorb nutrients or convert them to energy. They are vital for gut health, immunity, nervous system functioning, nutrient absorbtion, digestion... The list goes on. 📃 As humans, our bodies don't just do one thing at a time (even if we think we are). Just to be alive, all our systems are working internally. Imagine adding eating and drinking to that. Now let's add a job. Let's add a family. Let's add exercise. Our bodies are constantly working, there is no off switch 📴 Sometimes are bodies are under serious strain. If we are not getting the vital nutrients we need to keep up with this pressure, major problems can occur within the body. 😞
.
.
I don't give opinions on this very often but I'm going to for this one. If you are constantly worrying/counting macros and not focusing on food quality that's fine, you'll get the fuel you need for your body. But overall, internally, you are not focusing on the other functions in your body. Your body is more than just an engine that you need to fuel. It's complex and deserves to be treated like your most important possession. Because really, that's what it is 🤔🤔🤔 #foodisnorethanfuel #eatforhealth #eatforperformance #fitlife #fitlifestyle #fitliving #healthylifestyle #fitfam #irishfitfam",101,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/56609014_2801661339874760_3501395123311546620_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=shFK8jZ2AOkAX-Io5YV&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfDy9kFHo-pDhL5Jk1fYVJmhBDjvjoGgPCqmcqOJRvvcjA&oe=63D76866,https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv6Bv1xB_Ky/,17876803495334479,,,,
23,2019-04-05T16:30:13+0000,"Let's just get one thing straight the optimal body composition for EVERYONE is a high lean muscle mass and a lower body fat mass. That includes having strong bones, joints, ligaments and tendons. This is the composition our body thrives on and is most healthy in. That is the body composition everyone should be aiming for. 👌 Now, that doesn't mean you will get muscular or bulky 😂 I understand that my muscle mass is not for everyone but believe me, most of you will never have to worry about that 😂
.
.
How to gain muscle:
👉 First thing you need is a lot of patience. Especially if you want to gain muscle and remain relatively lean. The difference between these photos is 4 years and there's still not that much difference 😂
👉 You need food. Food is fuel. Generally, you need to be in a slight calorie surplus to gain muscle. Protein and carbs are your best friends ❤️
👉 Resistance training. From my experience, volume and time under tension are 2 of the main aids for gaining muscle. Rep ranges of about 8-12 are working in a hypertrophy range of building muscle. But it's good to mix strength, hypertrophy and endurance.
👉 Frequency. Don't expect results from training twice a week. It's not necessarily about training 2 hours a day every day but frequency is important. Train smarter not harder.
👉 Recovery. This relates to food, hydration, sleep and physical rest. Your body needs to repair itself to grow.

24,2019-04-04T07:15:46+0000,"This is one I get asked on a lot. So here is a very general guide.
.
.
Step 1: Weight in kg x (22-24)
- 22 Low Activity Level daily - 23 Medium Activity Level daily
- 24 High Activity Level daily
.
.
Step 2: Mutiply this number by training frequency level (1.2 - 2.0)
- 1.2 - Little to no training
- 1.4 - Training 1-3 times per week
- 1.6 - Training 3-5 times per week
- 1.8 - Training 6-7 times per week
- 2.0 - Training 6-7 times a week with highly active job or 2+ per day
.
.
Step 3: Adjust for goals
If maintenance is a goal. You have it. If weight loss is a goal minus the percentage body weight you want to lose. If weight gain is a goal add the percentage body weight you want to gain.
.
.
Example: 30 year old woman who works at a desk job wants to lose 6kg. She is currently 66kg and trains about 3 times a week.
66 x 22 = 1452

1452 x 1.4 = 2032

2032 x 90% (wants to loose 10% BW) = 1832 per day (you could go a little lower if you wanted to speed up weight loss, this number is for a slow, sustainable weight loss) .
.

0,2019-04-02T07:31:48+0000,"Are Macro and Micro Nutrients important for Athletes??? YES!!!!
.
.
Let's delve into what we need each nutrient for and requirement levels.
.
.
Protein 🥩🍳🥓
Every cell in your body needs protein. Protein is absolutely essential for athletes due to the amount of training they are doing. Protein turnover is very high so demands for protein are also very high. We need it for recovery and muscle repair. It is also very important in times of injury. I recommend 2g per Kg of Bodyweight.
Sources include: Meat, Fish, Eggs, Beans, Legumes. Eat protein at every meal.
.
.
Carbohydrates 🥔🥪🍚
Carbohydrate is the preferred fuel for GAA. It gives us energy in the form of glucose or stored glycogen. There are 2 types of carbohydrates:Complex carbohydrates and simple sugars. Complex carbohydrates are the ones we want most of in our diet. They not only provide fuel but also fibre which is essential for gut health. I recommend about 3g per Kg Bodyweight. This can increase days of games/trainings or day before to almost 6g per Kg Bodyweight. Sources include: Rice, Oats, Fruit, Potatoes, Sweet Potato.
.
.
Fats 🥑🌰🧀
Fats are often neglected and are a very important part of an athletes diet. Fats reduce inflammation (caused by exercise or injury), they are part of our cell membranes and they transport vitamins A, D, É & K. I recommend about 1-1.5g per Kg BW. This can increase or decrease based on carbohydrate consumption. Sources include: Avocado, nuts, seeds, dark chocolate, oily fish
.
.
Micronutrients 🍉🥦🥒
These are often overlooked. Although they are required in small quantities, lack of consumption can lead to serious deficiencies. Not only is immune function lowered increasing risk of catching colds and illnesses which can increase absenteeism from training. Cognitive function can be impaired (not ideal on a pitch). Micronutrient deficiencies in some cases can cause fatigue like a lack of Iron or B Group Vitamins. Water would also be considered a micronutrient

.
.
People assume I've always been confident. This is so far from the case. Confidence is not something you are born with. It's something you choose to become, in my opinion 👌
.
.
I'll tell you my struggles with confidence we've all had them.
.
.
When I was a teenager I struggled with my appearance. I would wear make up every single day. I would never be seen without make up. I was so afraid what people would think of my bare face 😩 Would Boys still like me😩 I struggled with body image (as most teenagers do). I was tiny. But I always thought I could be thinner. My distorted image of exercise was for weight loss only. It just helped that I actually liked football. 😔
.
.
Football was my biggest confidence barrier. Because I was never skillful I never really believed in myself. I wasn't the player people 'talked about'. EVER. I made my club and school team. I was always on the bench for Roscommon so I did what I needed to. Then, my first year in college I was picked for the O Connor Cup squad. I was one of only 7 first years. But nerves crept in rather than confidence. I remember playing a 7s competition with some very big names from Dublin and Donegal and I just flopped. I had no confidence in my ability. I couldn't overcome the nerves. And I struggled with this for afew years in college.
.
.
When I came out of college. I questioned myself with my career. Am I good enough? Do I know enough? Do I practice what I preach? Do I look good enough"" (for a personal trainer)?
.
.
Fast forward to getting older and wiser. And speaking to a lot of people along the way❤️ I'm make up free most days🤣 I'm still not skillful but I'm fairly confident in my footballing ability 👌 What I look like has no correlation to the trainer I am. Which is a good one. As a nutritionist, I base my beliefs and advice on science. I don't know everything. I'm constantly learning and I love it 😁 I'm not perfect but then again, perfect doesn't exist 👆👆👆 #fitlife #confidence #confident #fitness #fitlifestyle #fitliving #eatforhealth #eatforperformance #fitfam #irishfitfam",169,1,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/54248096_2059906424131625_2375291190810169030_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=nQr5eFKTtX4AX-7K7eR&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfAuTAsNGrjQ_MoEpRXlAUVkNe8gI3P5v28sagmYoqjg_Q&oe=63D797E7,https://www.instagram.com/p/BvlZ-R9B0Lv/,17974453411228801,,,,
3,2019-03-28T08:19:25+0000,"I have 2 regrets from the last 20 years of playing football. Not much over 2 decades. My first one was not doing a j1 because of football 🙊 My second was not playing my last ever O Connor Cup game with UCD because I was sick 😭 (which I was my whole final year 😩)
.
.
Because I never went away or went further than the Canaries I thought I had no interest in travelling. 3 years ago, My friends were travelling South East Asia and my Dad had just died when I decided I'd meet them in Thailand for a holiday. It absolutely blew me away. What had I been missing out on all this time. The scenery, the culture, the heat, the sun, the food, the buckets 🤣🤣🤣 The best day of my life to date was in Thailand. Since then, I've become a boring dry shite day to day. My weekends are always football based so I don't go out. I can't really go away. So I save up now, for holidays. Last year I was on 17 different flights. This year is a little more low key but I'm already making big plans for next year 😊
.

Everyone is different but for me holidays and travel are life. I need them. They relax me (and there's no other way of doing that 🤣).

'I just want to say a huge thank you for the past 8 weeks. The variety in the exercise programme was excellent and after each few weeks, the new programmes added new challenges and mixed everything up. The nutrition is the side I struggle with more and you really helped in this regard and were there to answer any questions straight away. I have learned so much and how to find a balance at last so thank you so much. I have tried programmes before but this was so much better and the only one I stuck to thanks to your support and check ins. I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to improve their health and fitness'

.
.
First thing is first, you need to figure out is your goal. If its weight loss. Calories are king. Not low cárb or high cárb or keto or Atkins. Calories. Being in a caloric deficit. Please don't use myfitnesspal calories as they cut you down to insanely low daily intake 😱 Which will have an impact on your BMR and is not healthy long term. Get a professional to help you and THEN you can log them into my fitness pal (if you have the patience, I personally don't). Sometimes healthy options are higher in calories than processed counterparts. So yes you CAN overconsume healthy food and sometimes the lower calorie option is better for your goals.
.
.
If health is the goal. We're mainly talking whole nutritious foods. We're talking very little processed food. We're thinking about our insides not just our outside 🙏 It's probably more a long term goal.
.
.
If performance is the goal our macro and micro nutrients become far more important. Are we getting enough protein for recovery? Do we have a good cárb fuel store? Are we using fats as an anti inflammatory? Are we eating enough fruit and veggies for our immune system?
.

Figure out your goal. Seek help from someone qualified. Get a coach.

.
.
Am I eating enough calories? Do I need a lot of carbs? Is protein that important? How much water should I be drinking? What are micros? Is strength and conditioning really important? How much sleep is enough? How many rest days do I need? Is mobility essential? Should I be foam rolling more often? Are ice baths important? Is alcohol really that bad? ❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓

Athletes these days have so much to think about. And that's before they take into account their own personal lives and jobs 😴😴😴 You need to listen to your body. You need to sleep. You need to relax. You need to recover properly and eliminate the risk of injury. You need to be able to talk to a coach and explain how you are feeling.
Remember, spórt is a hobby. While it's a massive part of your life. Don't let it control it👌 Enjoy it, don't feel like it's a chore. 💯

After years of doing my own thing in the gym with little or no results I decided to undertake Amanda's 8 week challenge. For me my aim at the end of this challenge was far more about mobility and strength rather then aesthetics. I had experienced so much difficulty from a cartilage issue in my knee that I felt I was so limited in what I could do. In general I'm quiet petite and have never had any issue with my weight however I wanted to see if I could tone up and get stronger while working through the problem with my knee. The program that amanda gave me was absolutely unbelievable.she knew exactly what I was looking for and tailored my plan to include strength exercises that would build up all the muscles around my knee allowing me to lift heavier weights and incorporate more cardio into my routine, something that I had been so afraid of in case I damaged my knee more. The 8 weeks with Amanda is worth so much more then any amount of sessions with a physio. I can now walk around pain free and have mobility back in my knee. My whole body has toned up and I am so much stronger. This program has made me enjoy the gym again and amanda herself is worth her weight in gold both professionally and as a personal friend. I would recommend this program to anyone who wants to change things up a bit or try something different you will not regret it.

Amanda was so helpful in answering all my questions throughout the eight weeks and I had quiet a few. She was supportive and encouraging every single week. I feel I’ve learned a lot more about nutrition and training in relation to my own body. I understand the importance of a rest day and to allow time for recovery. Before this programme going to the gym was something I didn’t really look forward to. I was ticking a box. I wasn’t getting the best use out of my time in there. I also lacked a lot of confidence when it come to lifting weights and what exercises I should be doing. Over the past few weeks I have increased steadily in all my weights with the slower exception of arm exercises but still getting there. I enjoyed the fact that Amanda tailored the programme to work around my schedule as some days it wasn’t possible for me to get to the gym so instead I had home workouts. I will continue on with the change in my diet it isn’t restrictive it’s balance and cop on which took me a while to get my head around not feeling so guilty after having a bad few days. She was a pleasure to work with I’m going to miss the weekly check ins. Thanks so much Amanda xx

This meant that I could get my gym sessions in when it suited me, I could pick and choose from the longer or shorter workouts depending on the circumstances of the day.  The workouts were switched up a number of times to continue challenging my body and she even managed to give me fantastic, challenging, realistic workouts minus the dreaded burpees!!
The nutritional plan is absolutely fantastic, I never found myself hungry nor did I ever feel I was depriving  myself or “on a diet”. Amanda checked in by phone on a regular basis to see if I needed any information or indeed inspiration and was happy to answer any questions I had for her. 
My results after the 8 weeks have been fantastic, I am so proud of what I have achieved but more importantly what I have learned.  Having spent years dieting and thinking I knew lots about nutrition, I have found that I finally have found a sustainable, healthy way of living and eating. 
Fitness and health are about more than being the perfect size or hitting certain targets in the gym, it’s about training your mind and learning to think differently.  Amanda has given me the tools to do this and I look forward to continuing my journey to a fitter, stronger me and working with Amanda again in the future.  I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Amanda to anyone.",79,2,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/52845396_156240988723479_4122540119439138521_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=4_ollUsG40oAX-qxm_Q&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfBVAcLj3a0S0f4pjgumyejdfqBz7Oun51SaABJjfov0pg&oe=63D7716C,https://www.instagram.com/p/BvC9HZGB5z2/,17857183171363854,,"[{'timestamp': '2019-03-16T11:10:11+0000', 'text': '❤️', 'username': 'roisinallen1', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '18045700045013750'}, {'timestamp': '2019-03-15T22:45:10+0000', 'text': '#fitlife #fitlifestyle #fitliving #busymum #onlineclient #propernutrition #sustainable', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '17862126295353288'}]",,

Well I have to say a huge thank you to Amanda McLoone, she has definitely put me on the right road for nutrition and fitness and it’s something that I want to carry on.  I feel great, and am just loving this new lease of fitness and energy.  Amanda just made it so easy for me, her down to earth manner and enthusiasm for what she believes in and it really made me believe in myself.  I have tried WW, slimming world and I now realise I don’t have to eat half a pound of pasta to feel full.  Amanda gave me a tailored plan which is what I love, so I had direction and knew what I was eating day to day, plus the treats, thanks Amanda. And it was so helpful to have weekly calls from Amanda, could ask her anything.  And on the plan its great to know that it is normal day to day food and didn’t have to drive to different shops to get what I needed. 
Her fitness plan works wonders and yes you have to do your workouts, this is all part of it and it does work, I was determined to do this and by god I am such a happy women that I did. 
I still have my nutrition plan on my fridge and am still making the recipes that you gave me, love them, Amanda you a great women and make me want to achieve more from what I learned from you and your drive. 
If you want change in your life and a new drive, get in contact with Amanda, I am certainly a new woman.

.
.
Firstly, this is down to you and your goals and how much you want to achieve them. To me, personally, holidays are holidays. I enjoy them and am totally out of routine. Sometimes I train, sometimes I don't. But these are some tips to help with your goals.
👉 Walk everywhere. I clock up way more steps away than in Ireland. 20,000 plus per day.
👉 Enjoy your food, but don't take the piss. I always opt for a healthier breakfast and got to town on either lunch or dinner 🐷
👉 Keep hydrated. Especially if you are having mimosas at breakfast😂
👉 Skip the snacks. When I'm at home I'm constantly grazing but when I'm away I try to go for 3 main meals.
.

Hope thís helps. P. S Budapest had the most amazing Brunch places 😍 Enjoyed it a lot 😊

17,2019-03-07T08:18:09+0000,"If you're like me and calorie counting is not your thing. All is not lost. Yes calories matter but so does your life and if you absolutely hate the thought of entering everything you eat into my fitness pal, as a trainer I would never force you 😉Most if not all of my clients have achieved their incredible results from never having entered a calorie or macro into myfitnesspal 👏👏👏
.
.
I am not slating it. It obviously works for people. And whoever uses it and enjoys tracking, go you 👍 There are some reasons why the calories on our food labels don't actually correlate to real life though 🙈So it's not a 100% fool proof method.
👉 Fibre and resistant starches are often overestimated
👉 Some of the data is outdated or the analysis of it was imprecises
👉 Only one product is tested so it doesn't take into account product variety
👉 Soil composition and animals diets are not taken into account
👉 Ripeness at time of harvest. Ever taste in season Irish strawberries vs imported out of season😏
👉 Storage, preparation and cooking of food can change nutritional composition of food
.
.
Some of my top tips if you're not interested in tracking:
💥 Protein at each meal (approx 2g per Kg BW)
💥 Load up on veggies (full of micros and volume, low in calories)
💥 Portion size (use a smaller plate and watch those cárb and fat portions)
💥 Fibre rich foods (fruit, veggies, legumes, some complex carbs)
💥 Drink plenty of water. A lot of the time we're actually thirsty not hungry
.
.
And just keep active. Technically, you don't have to if you're nutrition is on point. But come on, we are so lucky to be able to exercise. Enjoy it 😍

There's no right or wrong way to do it. If you want to have your Mam's pancakes lathered in butter, enjoy it. If you want to opt for the healthier option, enjoy it. If you don't want pancakes, don't have them. There's no hard rule. Just whatever you do own it. Don't winge or complain that you've went over your calories. Or don't give out about how boring your banana pancakes with berries were😏😏😏

Do you resistance train throughout the year? Do you strength train pre season? Are you watching your nutrition? Are you recovering properly?

These are all factors athletes now need to take into account. It's not as simple as pitch sessions anymore, especially if you're at a higher level 👌👆

4.5 Years ago I tore my ACL. I was back on the pitch within 6 months and I haven't had any issues since 🤞🤞🤞 For the last 4.5 years I have kept up the strength work I did for rehab. I didn't do it sporadically. I've don't it consistently. I've eaten well. I've maintained a good body composition. Injuries are crap but they are something that cannot be neglected. You need to work on them long after they have 'healed'.
Or you need to prevent them. Either way, resistance training should be a part of every athlete's routine 😎

***Disclaimer: This will not be relevant to a lot of people. Take into account my training schedule etc.***
.
.
Last week for possibly the first time ever I tracked calories 🙈 And I was shocked to see how much lower my calories were than they should be for maintenance. I kinda knew I was in a deficit but thought ah sure losing a little body fat would do no harm 😜🙈
.
.
You see when you drop your calories and your exercise activity is still high, your Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) drops. Because you are eating less your Thermic Effect from food(TEF) drops. Being in a deficit also means energy can suffer. 🤷‍♀️ .
.
So I decided to up my cals and carbs. And I've never felt so good or more lean 👌😁 I trained 6 times this week and still had energy for a game today. My sleep has been great. My mood is incredible 😍
.
.
This mostly relates to athletes especially women. Less is not always best. You need to fuel your body. You need to recover well. You need your hormones, enzymes and antibodies to function properly. If you need help or advice seek it 👌

So the reason most people fail at their health and fitness routine is because they go from zero to 100 in a week 😔 It's a  sure recipe for success😞

You need to make much smaller steps. And make a new one weekly. All these small steps will make your fitness journey so much easier 👌

Let's take a breakfast for an example. If you're used to a big breakfast roll with a bottle of coke on your way to work, chances are you're not going to get up at 6am before work to make some 'Smashed avocado on sourdough topped with poached eggs' 😂🥑 Why not pick up a breakfast wrap minus the butter and ketchup and a coke zero. Maybe after a couple of weeks you might bring some Overnight oats with you 👌

If your regular water consumption is less than 500ml, forcing 2L down your throat is torture.

I think you get the picture. Stop trying to be perfect. Perfection doesn't exist. Don't try a lifestyle overhaul. Make small changes. Be more conscious when shopping.

.
.
RDL, Good Morning, Rack Pull, Bent Over Row etc. All require this movement. From training people the last 5 years, I know people struggle with it for various reasons: tight hips, lack of flexibility or lower back issues
.
.
If you cannot get into this position, you have no business lifting weights.
👉 Work on movement with a stick and progress onto a band
👉 Improve flexibility
👉 Get a trainer to help you with exercises and watch your technique

I heard it on the radio the other day and we are an 'extremes' country. It's all or nothing there's nothing in between. We're constantly 'grinding' I remember a point a few years ago and it was literally like a competition to see who got less sleep 🙄😑 We're either in health and fitness 100% or we binge eat and sit on our arses. 🤔
We're either drinking every weekend or we go cold turkey for a month (#dryjanuary).
.

These extremes are so hard to withstand. They put us under pressure, our bodies and our mind.

Lets try break away from extremes. Incorporate parts into daily life. Don't punish yourself for 'falling off the wagon' and a lie in is OK 🤣😱 Find a lifestyle that's sustainable. TAKE THAT HOLIDAY 🏖️🏜️

.
.
I made a confession last night that I'm an all out kinda gal when it comes to meals out, drinks too 🤤 The way I see it. I go out for dinner on average once a month. That is one meal out of approx 30 days, approx 150 meals. Its one 'bad' one. I also only drink on holidays. Its a very rare occasion. And super infrequent. Now my goals are not aesthetic. I could certainly be leaner, but my body doesn't function well on super lean. My body functions best at my current shape and performance is my goal 👌👌Therefore I'm at calorie maintenence so I don't need to overly worry about that one meal or that very infrequent drink 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️
.
.
But if your goals change this can change. Also if the frequency changes this can change. What about the other meals are they mainly healthy? You have to realise not all goals are the same. Just because I do it doesn't mean you have to 🤣And it may be affecting your goals?
.
.
It's what you do 'consistently' that matters not what you do once every so often. Achieving goals is all about Consistency and patience 👌👍 #canigobacktovegas #slushiesandjellyshots #consistency #fitlife #fitlifestyle #fitliving #balance #fitfam #irishfitfam",132,1,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/51895365_2157258781019544_4036515804249221765_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=l7sFvPuEWr8AX9MrD4r&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfDNte4PBAsdUN96m8lIbFTvtM0Ul6k3PSFJPiXOukXDhg&oe=63D8789F,https://www.instagram.com/p/BuQirgahVYA/,17867668660324714,,,,

.
.
Since I came home from holidays at start of January I have been training really hard. First for a competition and then for football. I was doing a seriously demanding strength programme with 1/2 wods a week plus pitch sessions🙈
. .
So this week, I pulled it all back. No hard training. 2 strength sessions (maintenance is now my goal though rather than increasing weights every week), 1 WOD (not a hard one this week) and 1 ball skills session.
.
.
I also had a chiropractor session and a great recovery package @acepandr. Today is Foam rolling and stretching ✌️
.
.
Remember, you don't have to be constantly 'grinding'. It's OK to reduce volume, take a Deload week, take a week off etc. Your body NEEDS rest and recovery. Since my recovery session in ACE my sleep has been incredible 😍 And the cold I had at start of the week is more or less gone 👌

.

So as I've said before here I'm a big fan of treats. I think we all deserve them (maybe not daily) but I think it's an important part of our enjoyment of food 👌👌👌
.
.
When it comes to macro nutrients these 2 products are not comparable. The protein bar is way higher in protein and the milkybar contains a lot of sugar. But both still contain calories. I'm not telling you to eat either or both. I just want you to understand that just because it's labeled as 'healthier' does not mean it doesn't contain calories 🙈 People could have 2 or 3 of these bars a day on top of their meals. So while you think you're eating well (and you probably are) you could be over consuming calories due to the nature of the foods your eating. This is obviously depending on goals. If goals are weight loss, calories are king. If goals are performance based, content of product becomes more important 👌
.
.
Take home point. Just because it's labelled as 'healthier' version doesn't mean it doesn't contain calories. Healthy foods contain calories too and we can over consume 🤔🤔🤔 Goals are too important. If you are an athlete looking to get the best from your body and looking to fuel yourself for your sport, it's different to you're average person just looking to lose afew pounds.

This is NOT an alcohol bashing post. I drink myself and Love a good night out 🍻🍷💃 BUT I do think the idea of dry January and people's struggles with it is a pile of 💩

OK so firstly, it's 31 days. Is it really that hard? As soon as February 1st comes do you REALLY NEED that gin and tonic??? 😏 If you really, really do then why did you bother doing it in the first place? To prove a point? To put it on social media? To tell friends? 🤔🤔🤔

The last few years I have cut down on my drinking. I actually rarely drink unless on holidays or special occassions. But when I do it, I do it because I enjoy it and the occassion involved in it👌 I don't drink at home and I don't go to the local for one or two. I don't drink for January or February most years as football season has started back and as hard as pre season is its so much harder with a week long hangover 😂 I am far from a pioneer but I'm certainly not dependent on alcohol 🚫🚫🚫

I am not saying people need to be like me. I'm not saying my method is the right one.

Make an educated choice. No foods should be demonised or considered 'bad'. It's all about understanding your goals and why you are eating what you are eating?!
.
.
I eat both of these. I like both of these. Neither are 'bad' or 'good' foods. One has more health benefits. The other has more taste benefits 🤤

.
If fat loss is a goal, all that matters is calories. Now, I'm still a firm believer in healthy nutrient dense foods but you can gain weight on healthy foods 🙈 Healthy foods do contain calories so just be aware of that. Similarly, you can lose weight on crap food but I do not recommend it 🚫🚫

 I was once where you are too. Actually so was everyone. Nobody is born with weights in their hands 🤣 And nobody is born super strong. Strength comes from effort day in, day out. Any fitness for that matter comes from the sum of all your daily efforts, week in week out. It's about consistency 👌👌

Last year I trained 50 out of 52 weeks (average 4/5 times a week). I took a week off the week after Connacht final and a week at Christmas. So no I am not naturally strong, I'm not naturally fit. It's not 'easier' for me. I'm an athlete. I train hard and reap the rewards ☝️☝️

Side note: I do have muscle but I don't look this pumped all the time 😂 💪

.
.
Things I would have told me 18 year old self:
1. Health is so much more important than weight (2 stone difference between pics)
2. Stop trying to be perfect. Perfection doesn't exsist
3. Relax a little. Don't stress so much. Good things come to people who work but remember there's a thing called life that needs to be enjoyed
4. Problems aren't solved at the bottom of a vodka bottle (only have learned this one in recent years 😣)
5. Fitness is NOT about being skinny. I would tell my 18 year old self to start lifting weights ❤️
6. Eat your bloody vegetables and stop being so damn picky. It feels so much better on your body and you'd have so much more energy
7. Make up isn't life. You are beautiful, stop hiding yourself with layers of foundation and baggy hoodies.
8. Appreciate everyone in your life. You think they will always be around. Unfortunately that's not the case 💔

19,2019-01-17T17:43:13+0000,"Pre season Nutrition🍏🍏 A question I get asked quite often is should nutrition be different pre-season and during season. The answer is yes. You should not be consuming the same calories in pre-season as you do during championship.
.
. 
Think about it though. Preseason is usually gym based with maybe one pitch session so activity levels are not as high. Compare that to full on championship mode, you may be on the pitch 3 times a week with one gym session. And this only takes one sport into consideration. You may have multiple sports.
If activity levels increase so too should calories and vice versa. If we are in a period of lowered activity, calories should therefore be lower. Overall calories are determined by gender, weight, activity level and goals.
.
. 
Macronutrient requirements will also be different. Protein requirements will be high in both cases as the need for recovery will be high i.e post gym session or post-match both require high protein. Protein targets are usually 1.8-2.2g per kg BW.
.
. 
Fats are also important for recovery and to reduce inflammation. These should be approximately 20% of our overall calorie intake.
.
. 
Carbohydrate is our main energy source during sport. Pre season however, requires less carbohydrate intake. We are focused on more short bursts of energy like Gym work or sprints which use a different energy system to matches. We don’t need to consume carbohydrate with every meal during pre-season and while our calorie requirements are also lower here might be a good place to start. We could substitute our complex carbohydrate rice with a lower calorie cauliflower rice or breakfast could focus more on a larger omelette with extra veggies rather than 2 slices of bread? These are just options of how to reduce calories but keep bulk and not feel like you are depriving yourself. .
. 
It is important to understand that these are two different periods of an athlete’s schedule. Just like we cycle training, we should also cycle our nutrition 👌

.
.
2018 was my most mentally challenging year. From January until mid October I suffered with problem after problem. They accumulated. Stress accumulated. My mental health deteriorated. Excess stress lead to niggly injuries. I wouldn't rest or couldn't recover because I was putting myself under too much pressure. My football performance suffered. My work suffered. With the help of @womensgpa I decided to seek counselling services and it was the best decision I've ever made. I'm not quiet about problems and issues. I've always talked about them. But sometimes you need more than just the ear of a sibling, partner or friends. Sometimes you need to seek professional help ❤️
.
.
So therefore, 2019 is for me. For the first time in my life I'm putting 'my' needs and wants first. Not those of others. It's for prioritising myself.

What did she think of it?
- So in general at the start of the 8 week challenge I would of called myself a reasonable active and healthy person! But really it wasn't until I received information from amanda that I realised I wasn't. 
I have always struggled with the nutritional point of view , so I think this 8 week plan really improved my knowledge of what I can actually eat and the portion size where I don't feel restricted.

I really enjoyed the plan and Amanda is great , she always has time for questions and is so motivating too !! I had one or two weeks where I really struggled and before I would of felt guilty but talking to Amanda I didn't and just realised days like that were going to happen but just to keep going and not worry!! If anyone is trying to learn and change overall not for a short time I really recommend this plan , it's great for anyone , no matter how active you are or if you hate exercise in general , she's makes this worth it !! Amanda caters a specific plan for each individual which I think proves how dedicated she is to her clients and her job !! Thanks Amanda ☺

When I went on holidays this time around I didn't train as much. It just wasn't a priority. There's no denying it, it's much harder to do when you're travelling around (at one stage I was on an island that there would be no access to any equipment) but I still could have done a body weight workout I just chose not to. It wasn't a priority. Spending every single second having fun was my priority and my God did I do that 😍 That being said I am looking forward to getting structure and a routine back. Not to mention get back training hard for my comp on 19th Jan 😜💪 It won't be a new year, new me but I suppose I have learned how to relax a little and that's a big change for me ❤️ #happynewyear #newyearsameme #holidayofalifetime #routine #2019 #goals",63,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/47468565_605830933194354_1926461416368970733_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=QbV767vpJycAX9ne9wk&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfAaIDJhB3ayrWIzOcdfNiqG6DRVtPOqBReylxM_MRSWLA&oe=63D94390,https://www.instagram.com/p/BsFdPn0BGbb/,18018156631043747,,,,

I promise I'll leave the rest until New Year I'm just so uber proud of all these girls. The physical and mental transformations they have undergone coming up to Christmas. Used to punishing themselves, they have such a better understanding and confidence and happiness in their bodies ❤️😭Lets see what she had to say... .

 You know exactly how to challenge the individual as well as an entire group which proves your education in the area, both fitness and nutrition. As for your plan, you listened to my brief, you catered so well to fit my gym plan around my sport as well as making sure I wasn't antagonising old/current injuries!! Nutrition/diet has always been my downfall and I always seem to hit a wall after 2 weeks of doing well. Your support during the 8 weeks never wained, you were always there, checking in with me, providing encouragement, advice and no question was too big or too small. The diet plan was easy to follow, fool proof and allowed for treats!  By the end of the 8 weeks I had the knowledge of what to eat and when based on my activity for the day. I feel so much more comfortable in my skin never mind my clothes! I now know how to manage my daily nutrition and it's your 8 plan that's taught me that, having you there coaching me through has made the difference...thank you!

.
.
If you're like me, you don't drink very often and enjoy a tipple over the festive season. Remember you didn't get it all in a few days, so you won't lose it in a few days. Alcohol will however, cause water retention, possible bloating depending on drinks and probably cravings the following day 🙈 90% of the time, I don't give into these and go back to normal eating habits. And that's probably why I can drink as part of a balanced lifestyle 👌
.
.
If you've been drinking since 1st December and use the whole of December as 'Christmas' things are gonna be a little harder for you 🙈But here's some of my tips:
1. Try a lower calorie option. Select from the above and try to stick with that. Pints and festive cocktails are laden with calories so beware.
2. Drink water between alcoholic drinks. You'll thank me the next morning 👌
3. Drink more water in general over the festive period. It will help flush you out💦
4. Eat a decent protein rich meal before heading out. And have a homemade snack ready when you get home to avoid chipper afterwards 🙈Once in a blue moon is OK but if you're out 4 times a week, it's a little excessive don't you think? My personal fav is toast with real butter🤤
5. Don't give into cravings the next day. Your body is dehydrated, tired and sore. It doesn't need more crap it needs nourishment. Again as I said, once in a blue moon is fine but if you are eating more 'hungover food' than normal food, then we have a problem 🙈
.

I will be enjoying my Gin and Slim tomorrow. Its my first of the holiday season and it won't be my last. But be mindful. Enjoy yourself but don't take the p*#s 😊

I wish I could show you their mental changes and their changes in attitude towards exercise and food 💕 That has been the biggest change I have seen 😍 I suppose the best thing I can do is give her words on the programme.
.
.
I started this programme as I wanted to lose weight and tone up and I was sick of doing the same workout in the gym over and over. I needed change and wanted a challenge to set coming up to the Christmas season. Working with Amanda over the past 8 weeks has been nothing but an absolute pleasure, she is highly educated in both the physical and nutritional side of things, with constant tips and information. She gave me constant support on both good days and bad, and always encouraged me to keep going.
 I’ve learnt so much more about exercises and how and when to fuel your body correctly according to your training days and rest days. The exercises were tough but good and easy to follow and she also posted demo videos on the group page demonstrating different exercises which was a great help. The weekly phone calls and check ins were brilliant too for motivation and friendly advice to help me reach my weekly goals. Amanda was so kind, understanding and helpful and was always a phone call or text away no matter what time of day it was. The food plan was easy to follow and was very easy to adjust to, it was full of delicious nutritional tasty foods, it also allowed for treats every now and again. It also helped me stop craving rubbish, I was never left hungry and was always full after a meal.
 I have more confidence now and self belief, as Amanda’s showed me how to enjoy going to the gym and exercising and to stop being so hard on myself if I have a bad day. Even thou this 8 week plan has come to an end I will certainly be keeping it up as it’s a new lifestyle and way of living Iv Learnt and love!! I can’t recommend Amanda and her programme enough, she is just such a delight to work with. If anyone is looking to lose weight, improve fitness and strength or even to just feel better in yourself and change their lifestyle and eating habits then this plan is for you.",66,1,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/47585597_344904826324867_4573913626388026332_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=05rHVk6dpGUAX8Hp98B&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfCV_G1bOf8PH18-t9W9J2C7HA8RWNMaJ6tSXNA9TCGL1A&oe=63D78564,https://www.instagram.com/p/BrR5UafBB_I/,18015003055063966,,"[{'timestamp': '2018-12-12T07:55:14+0000', 'text': '#fitliving #fitlifestyle #fitlife #healthylifestyle #healthyliving #nofadsorquickfixes #onlineclient #fitness #fitgirls #fitfam #irishfitfam', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '18009816697019554'}]",,

What has she to say?
I started this programme as I wanted to lose weight and I could never stick to a plan by myself as I would give up after weeks 2 or that. Working with Amanda over the last 8 weeks allowed me to have constant support and encouragement to keep going. Over the 8 weeks I’ve learned so much about exercises and what and when to eat during a day of activity. The weekly phone calls and check ins were really good for motivation and pushing yourself to reach your weekly goals. Amanda was so helpful and was always just a phone call or text away. The food and exercise plans were easy to follow and allowed for treats every now and again. I now have a lot more confidence in my body and enjoy going to the gym and exercising. Although the plan has finished I will certainly be keeping it up. I’d really recommend this programme to anyone who wants to change their lifestyle.

After 3 weeks I really felt I was going to give up (as I would have previously done with healthy eating / exercise) but having you there as such a positive support and motivating me made sure I kept going. My progress has completely changed by body and how I feel when I look in the mirror and I couldn't have done it without you. The plans were straightforward and I loved that the exercise was tailored to what suited me and my lifestyle. This 8 weeks has changed my attitude to food and exercise and I'll be keeping this up long after the 8 weeks is over.  I'd recommend this to anyone who needs a kick start to change their lifestyle!

19,2018-12-09T08:38:42+0000,"Let's talk stress 🙈 The whole world is taking about calorie deficits and training hard, did you know that maybe you're 'grinding' too much 🤔
.
.
What do I mean?
👉 We're always told, be in a calorie deficit to lose weight and exercise more? Right. But what if you're body is under chronic stress and you are not sleeping right? Will this affect you? Yes!!! Chronic and acute stress release hormones and neuro transmitters that tell our body to go into 'fight or flight' mode. These hormones and neurotransmitters especially norepinephrine switch off digestion and the GI tract making it very difficult to absorb nutrients 🚫🚫🚫
.
.
My own experience with stress. And how I learned to cope🤔🤔🤔
I have been a worry wart from day dot. And a control freak. I used to stress out so badly. I remember the tell tale signs would be on my skin if I was going through a really bad period of stress 😩 During my leaving cert I lost loads of weight and my hair started falling out due to stress 😔Before my Dad died, he asked me to try and relax and something triggered in me. I knew I needed to put things in place or I would end up running myself into the ground. And I had improved so much until this year🙄 This year tested me. A roller-coaster doesn't do it justice, so I realised I needed help. I started seeing a  counsellor and I have been seeing her for the past month 😊 (My issues are not as simple as I'm stressed they go way back so that's what I needed help with).
.
.
What can you do?
So while you may not need to go to the extreme I did. You need to manage your stress levels. The body does NOT want to be in fight or flight mode. It wants to be in 'rest and digest' mode. So you need to sort your stress out acute or chronic 🚫🚫
.
.
Self care is vitally important. I have only really started learning that since my Dad died. This year with the help of my counsellor I've realised that who's going to look after me if I'm trying to look after everyone else🤔 It's absolutely necessary to put yourself first sometimes.

If yes, what way will you train? You may have to reduce volume or frequency? Rather than train 5 days you may need to reduce to 2 or 3. Or maybe you'll just go out for a walk, run or cycle?

If no, take responsibility for your choice. Don't moan or whinge after Christmas. Just own it and get back on it after Christmas 👍

Everyone is different. There is no right or wrong answer. You shouldn't feel guilty about your decision but you do have to own your decision. 👌😬

.
.
Firstly, let me start by saying I'm not a grinch 😂 I love Christmas as much as the next person and I enjoy myself too 👌 But I don't take the absolute p*#s either 😙 Here's my top tips on how to not ruin your progress over the holidays 🎄
.
.
1. Relax. It's not Christmas yet. I'm all for YOLO and all that but there's no need for the celebrations to be out on 1st December 🙄 If you take the whole month of December to celebrate one day, you WILL ruin your progress 😬
.
.
2. Keep active 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️Get out in the fresh air, bring the dog for a walk, take part in a charity swim, go for a cycle or even a home workout 👍 Being 100% sedentary will do you no favours 🙏
.
.
3. Stay hydrated 💧💧💧 Simple tip but one of the most important 👌
.
.
4. Try stick to one 'bad meal' a day. If you want a fry in the morning, stick with a healthy lunch and a wholesome dinner. If you are going out for dinner, opt for a protein rich breakfast and maybe a salad for lunch.
Top tips for eating out:
- Stick with 2 courses or a main meal with a couple of drinks
- For a main meal, try a high protein/high cárb/low fat option or high protein/high fat/low cárb
.
.
5. Be cautious of drinking your calories. Check out my last post on how calorific festive hot drinks are 🙈 With Alcohol, stick to clear drinks with a diet mixer or water. Steer away from creamy cocktails or baileys 🤷‍♀️
.
.
6. The most important part is ENJOY yourself. It's a time of year to spend with family and friends and appreciate what you have ❤️ You don't need to be the prude sitting in the corner with fish and greens but you also don't need to do a 10,000 calorie challenge every day 😂 Find a balance that means you'll enjoy yourself but you'll also keep an eye on your goals 😊
.
.
P. S if you decide to eat like an asshole. Own it and don't come whinging in January. 🙄🙈 Nobody wants to hear it 😅

So this time of year its very tempting to exchange your regular americano for a blackforest mocha 🤤 And while one every once in awhile is a perfect treat if you change this to a daily routine while keeping your normal diet you may be adding a serious amount of extra calories to your overall weekly intake 🙈 Just because it's liquid don't think it doesn't count 🙈😢

This goes for everything. We let our mental health deteriorate before we decide to do anything about it. We only work on our stress levels when we've had a breakdown. We only start looking after our diet when we've been diagnosed with an illness. We don't exercise until we have weight to lose. We don't sort injuries until they stop us from working. We take shortcuts, tablets, pills, shakes all to avoid  reality, which is actually so much easier. .

.
.
 I put up a poll the other day and was disappointed to see over 30% of people found it restrictive. I didn't ask reasons why but here's my thoughts on the whole matter. 💭💭💭
.
.
What even does 'Healthy eating' mean?
That's a very subjective statement but here's my opinion.
👉 Food that nourishes your body
👉 Food that fuels your body
👉 Food for body and mind
👉 Non restrictive
.
.
I believe healthy eating is eating 80% of the food that the body needs and 20% of the food the body wants 😉❤️
.
.
That being said there are healthier versions of everything these days. As above 😍👆🤤
.
.
☑️And I also think as you get older you realise health is important.
☑️It's becoming realitively inexpensive. ☑️You feel better, look better, sleep better. The list is endless
.
.
If you find it restrictive you're doing it wrong. ❌❌❌ You need to grow up a little. Yes vegetables are important and you should be eating them with most meals. Health should be more important than a bowl of coco pops in the morning. Water should make up 50-60% of your body, if it's not, your body doesn't function properly🚫
.

.
.
You know this is as insulting as calling someone obese.
.
.
Firstly, everyone has a different reason for getting into fitness. Not everyone's journey is weight loss. Mine certainly wasn't as you know. For me, fitness has been a release. It's my way of dealing with stress and always has been. Stress affects people in different ways. Some overeat, some undereat, and  some do nothing. I exercise. Like everyone, I have loads going on outside of what you see on this. So what better way to relieve any excess stress than exercise ❤️
Strength was my other reason for getting involved in fitness. I was tiny and so weak. I initially did it to get stronger for football. But now I just absolutely LOVE the feeling of seeing what my body is capable of 😍 Exercise should not be about punishing yourself. It should be a celebration of what your body can do 🙌🙌🙌
.
.
Secondly, how I look should never come into it. If I was overweight would you say 'you're not a good role model'. It doesn't matter what size or shape you are. If you are good at what you do and want to help people for the better who cares if you've been fit all your life or if you just under went your own transformation 🤷‍♀️

Look at that date. Take it into account. Is it a special date? Maybe to some. Not to me. (Well it's exactly a month to my hols so maybe a little excited 🙈🏖️)

Don't let the last 6 weeks before Christmas ruin the progress you've worked so hard all year to achieve. 🙄 And no I'm not being a grinch. But there's no need to buy that box of celebrations yet. And the alcohol that's on sale won't be past its sell by before December 25th.

12,2018-10-30T20:14:09+0000,"How to get back on track after weekend of bad food and alcohol??? 😥😥😥
.
.
Remember it is what you do MOST of the time that will be a reflection of your health and body composition. 🙌 NOT what you do SOME of the time.
.
.
So if this weekend was the first weekend in weeks/months that you went out then chances are you won't do huge damage to progress. But if it's a regular occurrence and you're complaining that you're not seeing results. Remember the weekend is 35% of your week, so if it's consistently a problem this will have an impact on results 🙈🙈🙈
.
.
What to do?
👉 A wise woman once said to me, when you make a mistake think of the 3 f's. Forget about it. F*#k it. You didn't kill anyone did you 🙈 And fix it. The way you fix it is not by overdoing the cardio or living on fish and leaves for the week. Instead go back to normal eating habits
👉 Drink plenty of water.
👉 Catch up on sleep. Sleep is one that is undermined.
👉 Get back to exercise. Even if you need to wean your way in with a walk or something light. You'll always feel better afterwards

Hope everyone enjoyed their Bank Holiday 🙌🙌🙌 #healthyliving #healthylifestyle #health #fitliving #fitlife #fitlifestyle #balancedlifestyle #fitchick #fitfam #irishfitfam",129,2,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/43913817_303101670290839_3323054223314943551_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=4Esc60vyuOgAX9ta9IO&_nc_oc=AQnQuf-wlJQFzTd_JMQ4nzfz0aNi9klRqLGKTjXRJpeze166Egkkhu4yknyIVPGZgFanv52IFKSi5JEkve-g884T&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfAuUfiBcJM5LLiAz7zm9xtd9KkuW0dwlgmAFy3bhSAchw&oe=63D8B4CB,https://www.instagram.com/p/Bpkf0vogP_H/,17972284303086667,,"[{'timestamp': '2018-10-30T21:50:46+0000', 'text': 'Great post. 👏👏👏', 'username': 'sineadmcc90', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2018-10-30T22:03:17+0000', 'text': '@sineadmcc90 thanks a mill 😊', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '17968085998137622'}]}, 'id': '17994535939033326'}]",,

15,2018-10-24T17:14:12+0000,"⁉️Did you know that we have 11 systems in our body?? 🤔
.
.
⁉️Did you know that they work in conjunction with one another?? 🤔
.
.
⛔ If you have an issue with one system you could be putting other systems at risk.
.
.
➡️ Take your digestive system for example. If you are not absorbing nutrients properly it can have an impact on your skeletal system (in the case of calcium)
➡️ If your stress hormones are imbalanced it can have an impact on your integumentary system (hair loss)
➡️ When your nervous system is out of whack, you may have a weakened immune system

The list goes on. The point is. Look after all parts of your body. No part is more important than the other. Looking healthy externally means nothing if you aren't healthy on the inside 👌 This doesnt just mean exercise and nutrition. It goes for every part of your health ❤️ And don't forget to enjoy life while you live your healthiest life 💋

Yet recently aesthetics seems to be the primary goal for most 😩 Now, a healthy body composition will occur with regular exercise it's not the ONLY reason to exercise 😒 Recently, some of my clients have started saying they 'want to gain knowledge' or they 'want to be healthier' or 'they want a healthy relationship with food and exercise'. These are the sort of goals I want to hear 😍 These people are in it for the right reasons. ❤️

Exercise is not a punishment. We are so blessed and lucky to be able to exercise. Please start seeing that and stop treating your body poorly.

.
.
I always talk about goals and how important they are. Well priorities link in with your goals. There is no right or wrong answer to this. We all have priorities. Some of us have them without even realising. 🙄
.
.
What do I mean?
👉 I prioritise my health. Therefore, I eat well. I exercise. And I try my very best to reduce my stress levels and sleep well 👉 I prioritise holidays. Therefore, I don't go out very often so I can save money to go on holidays. 👉 I prioritise my family, friends and boyfriend. Even with a very busy schedule. I make time to see them. It may not be very often but I still make them a priority. 👉 I prioritise my job. The hours I work are often very unsocial but I make it work, because its a priority.
.
.
I often hear people say they 'care' about their health but are not willing to pay for healthy food. 🙄Others who 'care' about their friends but never see them😵. Those who want to build businesses but are only willing to work 9-5🙈🤔 People wanting to save for a house but are out every weekend 😔Then, there's the ones who want to lose weight🤯. They may care. But caring and prioritising are 2 very different things. Again, I am not giving out. Nobody needs to have the same priorities as me. But remember, for you to achieve your goals in life, no matter what they may be you need to prioritise. ✋✋✋ #priorities #ineverythingyoudo #healthyliving #healthylifestyle #healthyalternative #fitliving #fitlifestyle #fitfam #irishfitfam",113,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/42003481_327837167981086_4988297678238244235_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=fWmCYXGbPgsAX8Lh3na&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfAOhijYcigemRfHP3aSbiyRR59BSQuc4jSuTrXcCaCNRw&oe=63D7E233,https://www.instagram.com/p/BognjG7lNbB/,17970328525104416,,,,

.
.
These bars are virtually identical🙈 But If it has protein on it surely it's healthy?? 🙄
Wrong 😱😱😱
.
.
Are you buying protein bars because they are the 'healthier' option? What is the context? Why are they healthier? Because they contain protein? Because they have 'less sugar? Or maybe you are eating them to hit your protein target? Do you understand the term food quality? Anyway you should really understand 'why' you are eating what you are eating and if it will help towards your goals? .
.
I haven't tried them because
1. They are a rip off
2. I like the original
3. Protein bars don't agree with me
.
.
If it were me and I wanted a boost bar. I'd buy the bar (as long as I could stop at 1 bar and it's not a multipack). I would have it as a treat.
.
.
If you are eating protein bars as your treat, just understand why? P. S I am NOT anti protein bars but I am anti miseducation.

Those who know me know my Dad died 3 years ago. I was super close to him. I was devastated. That left a family of me, my sister and my mother. I'm not close to my mother and have an amazing relationship with my sister ❤️ My mother suffers from many mental health issues. Did before my Dad died and definitely has since. I've been in as many hospitals with her as I have with my Dad. It's hard. Like really hárd and a lot of the time she doesn't help herself (not gonna get too in depth). I am now a next of kin and at 27 you'd think you'd be able for that but it's actually a massive responsibility.

I loooove my lifestyle because its one I can adhere to. Its not restrictive (this is my version of non restrictive but others would probably find it restrictive). I have my treats if I want them. I drink occasionally. But I am consistent. I train regularly and 80% of the food I eat is healthy ❤️
.
.
Anything short of consistency will end in failure. I'll give an example:
- You train 3 - 5 times a week = 3 - 5 hours a week. You eat relatively well during the week but all hell breaks lose at the weekend (probably because you are so restrictive during the week). 1 drink turns into 10 on Saturday and Sunday = takeaway to cure the hangover 😭. ALL OF THE ABOVE IS INCONSISTENT. From training times to eating patterns to number of alcohol units. But now let's really throw a spanner in the works. You decide to take 2-6 weeks off training/diet to 'enjoy your summer' or 'holidays' 😩😩😩 And you wonder why you don't get results 😭
.
.
Unless you can find something that you can stick with, something you enjoy, something that is not a chore and are consistent with it, you're really not going anywhere 🙈😩
.
.
P. S I'm not saying you have to have the same lifestyle as me.

.
.
This is so do able and this idea that eating healthy is too expensive is absolute nonsense. You don't NEED to eat organically or buy all your food from health food shops. Of course, quality of food is important but if you're swapping from pot noodles to wholefoods you're doing pretty good 🤗
.
.
Some tips for shopping on a Budget
✔️ Look out for Aldi Super 6 on fruit, veg and meat (other supermarkets offer something similar so keep an eye out)
✔️ Shop early morning or late in the evening (there is often discounted foods with short best before dates)
✔️ Shop with a list
.
.
I have done up a short shopping list and meal plan. Take a look at my story 👌

It's very easy to think marinades or sauces don't count. But unfortunately they do 🙈 And they can be a big downfall for people. Take for example this marinade, the first ingredient is sugar 😱😱😱 When we compare it to natural flavourings like chilli powder or paprika which have minimal calories and very little processing 🤔
.
.
Another example of this is salad dressings. Salads can go from diet hero to zero in a matter of seconds. A lot of salad dressings are very calorific so be cautious 👹
.
.
The same goes for ordering food when you're out. Theres no point ordering the hake when you get the creamy sauce, creamed potatoes and vegetables lathered in butter. Believe me I'm all for 'treat yoself' but is it really helping you towards your goals? 🤔🤔🤔

I feel the fitness industry has changed. People are so focused on the outside, we forget about the inside. 👉 While having abs and being super lean looks good, is it worth the impact it has on mood, our hormonal systems, digestive system etc.
👉 People just see short term. Cuts and diets are everywhere. The long term is ignored. The impact of severe dieting on our body and the impact it can have in years to come is disregarded.
👉 People are more driven by aesthetics than health
👉 Terrible relationships with food are now the norm. 'Cheat meals' and 'binges' are commonly used terms on social media now. People over exercise to compensate for eating 'badly'.

.
.
Do you think your diet is sufficient??? 🤔
.
.
Unfortunately many of us need supplements, even those of u who have a balanced diet🤷‍♀️ Why?
👉 Food quality can be poor even 'organic' and 'wholefoods'
👉 Our lifestyle - high intensity exercise, high pressure jobs, long days, poor food choices etc
👉 Lack of availability of certain nutrients
.
.
These are the supplements I take and why
💊 Probiotics
Gut health is vital. Your gut sends signals to all the systems in our body and works in conjunction with them all. Day to day, we damage the bacteria in our gut. Not to mention what medication and illness can do to it. I recommend taking a 30 day course of Probiotics every once in awhile
.
.
💊Fish oils
It is recommended to eat fish 2-3 times a week. But did you know that white fish does not contain the same fats that oily fish do? So if you are only eating white fish you are not getting sufficient omega 3 fats. And furthermore, because our food quality has gone to s*#t, oily fish doesn't even contain enough omega 3 fats. So majority of people, even those with a good diet are not getting adequate omega 3 fats. I recommend a fish oil supplement for overall health. When looking for a fish oil supplement look for EPA and DHÁ content
.
.
💊 Vitamin D
Also known as the sunshine vitamin. Ireland does not have enough sunlight to produce adequate amounts of vitamin D in the body. We can obtain Vit D in our diet but the preferred form is sunlight. Vitamin D is required to absorb calcium as well as many other functions.
.
.
💊 Magnesium
Did you know that magnesium is needed for over 300 chemical reactions in the body? And we only absorb 20-50% of our dietary magnesium. I started taking this for muscle cramps. Magnesium Chloride is the most easily absorbed form. I get mine through magnesium oil. Epsom salts are another good form

What supplements if any do you take and why?

My job involves helping others. I love helping others. It's so important. But sometimes when it's just helping others and not looking after yourself it changes.

No but on a serious note. They taste nothing like pizza, nor crisps for that matter but they are an incredibly tasty way to get greens into you 🥗
.
.
Method
- Dé stem kale. Wash and pat dry.
- Sprinkle with oil and spices of choice. I go for chilli, garlic and paprika.
- Cook at 180 degrees for 10-15 mins. Keep an eye as they burn very fast 🙈

.
. 
So this one is probably gonna be a little shocker to some. And as with everything, this is all very goal dependent👌But sometimes the 'healthier' option is not the best option to suit your goals. But let me put that into a little more context 🤔
.
.
So I'm sure most of you have been lead to believe dark chocolate is 'better' for you. It is full of antioxidants, good fats and has been linked to many health benefits. But if you ABSOLUTELY hate it and are forcing yourself to eat it so you can have a treat, is it really healthy? To an extent, we should be eating foods that are more nutritious but your treats should also feel like a treat? Who's with me on that one? 🙋‍♀️
.
.
So the above photo shows a milkybar wowsome which has less calories, less sugar, less fat and practically identical protein to dark chocolate. So if your goal is weight loss the milkybar is actually probably the better option. Now if your goal is healthy eating, the dark chocolate definitely wins 🎉
.
.
Again it all is really goal dependent. I eat both. I like both. But my goals may not be the same as yours. I am not saying one is better for you than the other I am simply saying, make an informed choice when picking a 'treat' and please don't force feed yourself dark chocolate just because its 'healthier'. 🙈🙈🙈
P. S please don't take this out of context and start eating crap food because it is lower calorie😕

Now this is all goal specific. If weight loss is your goal you can do one of 2 things:
1. Lose it at a slow pace by making small changes
2. Lose it faster by making a total lifestyle overhaul
There is no right or wrong way. The 'best' way is the one you can sustain. But remember, there will be a sacrifice somewhere along the way. I'm OK with maintenance at the moment even if that means a couple of extra pounds.

23,2018-07-31T07:31:31+0000,"🦄Have a slow metabolism? What are you doing about it?
.
.
🐒So first things first, unless you have a hormonal imbalance which has been diagnosed chances are you don't have a anything wrong with your Basal Metabolic Rate. If you THINK you have a 'slow' metabolism it's probably because you don't look after your dietary intake and you have a sedentary lifestyle!!! 🙈🙈🙈
.
.
🦁People want to use excuses🤦‍♀️Some people genuinely have difficult circumstances to overcome and others are just full óf BS 😑😑😑
.
.
🐰I often get asked how do I have such a 'fast' metabolism, especially because I eat so much. Well my BMR is based on the fact that I have ALWAYS been active and in the last 5 years I have dramatically improved my eating habits. But it took 5 years, not 5 days or 5 weeks, 5 years👆👆
.
.
🦄Don't think after 6 weeks of exercise you are going to dramatically overhaul the years of lack of exercise. Changing from a takeaway at lunch to a salad for a week, will not correct all the damage to your hormonal system. It takes time to correct the damage you have done to your body. And unfortunately that is what it is. Lack of exercise and immobility is damage. Excessive body fat and lack of muscle mass is damage. In a lot of cases, it is also malnourishment.
.
.
🐒But you CAN change it. It won't happen in a week. It won't happen in a month. It may even take longer than a year. But you can improve it. Step by step. Day by day. Working on a lifestyle that is sustainable. A way of living that is healthy but not too restrictive.

.

Bulky? No. Add muscle? Yes.
Adding muscle does not mean getting bulky 🚫🚫🚫
.
.
To gain muscle in very large quantities you need
👉 Steroids
👉 Weight training multiple times a day
👉 A lot of VOLUME
.
.
This is all very hard to do. So don't worry by picking up a couple of dumbbells you are not going to turn into a bodybuilder. You are not a powerlifter when you pop a Barbell on your back. And you CERTAINLY won't turn into a Crossfit Games athlete by doing some wall balls 😂

.
You will however:
👉 Increase lean muscle mass
👉 Reduce Body Fat Mass
👉 Increase BMR - Basal Metabolic Rate
👉 Reduce Risk of Injury
👉 Improve bone mass density
👉 Get Stronger
👉 Feel more confident

I've said it before and I'll say it again, eating healthy does not have to be boring🚫🚫🚫. If you hate plain rice, don't eat it. Opt for the more interesting style and get some veggies in while you're at it 👌 Now I actually like plain rice and this is a rare treat to me (because I rarely get a chance to eat warm food and this is a steam pack 😭).
.
.
The best diet out there is the one YOU can stick to. If you can't stick to it, you're going nowhere. Now sometimes you may go hell for leather with an event coming up like holidays or a wedding etc (that's different). If you are constantly eating clean for 6 weeks and binging for the other 46 you have not found a sustainable way of living 😑😑😑
.

If you are unsure of what you should be doing to achieve your goals. Speak to a nutritionist or dietician 👍

I used to be you 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️ Genuinely I was the pickiest person going. Now I'm still a bit weird with some things touching each other on a plate and I'm never going to be a cauliflower fan but I've changed DRAMATICALLY. Why? Well to be totally honest I just grew up. I know it's hard for some to hear but that's exactly what it is. 🙈 Now obviously intolerances are a totally different kettle of fish 🤪 But if you are just choosing to eat broccoli as your only veg, fish doesn't exist in your diet and potatoes are your only starch and it's purely down to not trying other foods, you really need to broaden your horizons👊

You are missing out on so much nutrients and whole foods by keeping your diet so limited. You won't like them all. That's understandable but at least try 👍

I don't know if that makes me a fake or just human. 🤷‍♀️ What I do know is, it has made me extremely happy 😍❤️🙏 Last year I made a bucket list and I made a pact with myself to put me first ✔️ This year has been the most action packed fulfilling year in my life 👌💯 I will get back to more food posts and sharing exercise tips as it's my passion but I've realised it's not the only part of my life.

📍 Florida
📍 New Car
📍 Donegal with the girlos
📍 Galway with the college crew
📍 Ed Sheeran
📍 Connacht Title
📍 Benidorm with the Rossies

6,2018-07-02T09:13:54+0000,"Truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth 🙈🙈🙈 1. I drank waaaay too much on this holiday
2. I didn't eat near enough
3. I didn't have a micro in the 3 days
4. I didn't want a bikini pic because I was too embarassed (the swell was real) 
5. My sleep was terrible
6. The most exercise I did was jumping in and out of the pool
.
. 
Day to day none of the above happen (bar maybe no. 5🙈 due to lack of time). From time to time, we all change our habits. I needed a break. Now I probably didn't need all the alcohol 😱But otherwise the break was pretty darn necessary because I'm ready to get back into the gym today 👌💪
.
.
Some tips to get back on track after a few days like this
👉 Get back to normal eating habits,as soon as possible (I go straight back to it but if you find that hard start with a good breakfast and dinner and work your way to normality)
👉 Get water into you. In this weather 3-4L
👉 Get moving - yesterday I got about 10km walked. Today I'm back in the gym

10,2018-06-19T07:55:14+0000,"Health versus Calorie Control explained 🙄

This is a big topic for me. As a nutritionist, health is priority. Whatever nourishes your body will be what I advise. Food is fuel ⛽

Counting calories is constantly thrown all over my news feed. Flexible dieting and IIFYM. The list goes on.... 😑😑😑 1. So firstly, yes a calorie is a calorie. But the problem with some of these posts is, people see calorie for calorie comparisons, substitute foods based on these calorie comparisons but don't understand anything about their own caloric intake. I've seen doughnuts compared to wholefood bars, Alcohol compared to smoothies etc. People see 'fitness people' eating these foods so eat them themselves, uneducated to the fact that they may be in a calorie surplus while the said educator was probably eating this in a calorie deficit. Understand it is overall calories that count and each individual is different. Calorie intake is based on weight, height, age, gender, activity level, etc.
.
. 
2. While a calorie is a calorie. Micros count!!!!!! Eating a Mc Donald's every morning may 'Fit your macros' but my god are you missing out on the fibre, magnesium, Iron, Zinc, and B Group Vitamins that a big bowl of oats provide 🥣🥣🥣
.
. 
3. Gastrointestinal discomfort. I have a sensitive stomach so this MAY be just me but my God do I feel like crap after a takeaway/chocolate binge. Its fine every once in awhile but consistently is just hard 😱 Even if the calories were the same, I'd take my fish and greens any day🙋‍♀️
.
. 
4. From my experience and experience with other athletes, wholefoods improve performance. If you asked me to go play a game tomorrow under 2 different conditions 1. 2000 Cals of wholefoods, lots of complex carbs, healthy fats, protein and water versus 2. 2000 Cals of Chips, pizza and diet coke. I can tell you now which one I'd feel better on 🤪🤪🤪
.
.
So yes, a calorie is a calorie and calorie wise there is no difference between water and diet coke. And with regards Aspartame do your research. Again, it all comes back to goals.

Remember to never lose sight of your goals 👆They are key. They are drivers. 👆If your goal is weight loss and you are 'treating' yo self after every good thing you do, chances are you may be 'balanced' but only on the scales because you have cancelled out any deficit you were previously in 😫 But its not all about weight loss. I consider balance being able to go out with friends on social occasions for a meal or a few drinks. But I would not be able to do this every weekend with my lifestyle 🙄😴 That to me would be an imbalance ❌❌❌ I am not saying its all about deprivation. Far from it 🤟 Treating yourself is NECESSARY. But is it really a treat when it's happening regularly. I'm all for the YOLO but binge drinking every weekend and expecting fat loss is difficult (not impossible but really f*cking hard🤪) Whatever you do, take ownership for it 👊Goals are not easy to achieve but it depends on the effort you put in too. Minimal effort = Minimal results 😱

👉 Strawberries are an excellent source of Vitamin C (even higher than oranges), Vitamin K and Folate
👉 They are high in fibre
👉 Jam packed full of antioxidants
👉 100g of Strawberries = 30KCal (so they are great for dieters)
👉 They are so versatile. I have them in Greek yogurt, with salad or as a snack 🤩

14,2018-06-09T11:48:01+0000,"Advanced Core Workout 🐾🐾🐾 I'm not a big fan of isolation core work, I get bored very easy 🙈🙈🙈 But a strong core is key to all elements of fitness especially when lifting weights or pitch stability ✌️ I try to do a little core activation before resistance training so this is usually how I train my core but recently I've tried to do a little isolation work and it's helped improve other elements of my fitness especially my strength 💪

I wouldn't recommend these exercises to beginners as you need quite a lot of upper body strength and need to understand how to use your core. If you are a beginner, I recommend planks (all forms) and other exercises directed by a trainer 🙌 Remember if you are really serious about fitness, always speak to someone qualified in the area before starting 😁 Let me know if you try any of them 😁

I eat really really well and train 5-6 times a week (pic 1). There is a time and place for this in my life. But it's not the only part of my life 👆

Fast forward to pic 2. I'm just home from a weekend of 🥂 and 🍫. I've been carrying injuries so I haven't been as consistent with training but I still eat really well 👆

Life is not about being ripped 24/7. Life is about memories. Life is about experiences. Life is about spending time with loved ones. Life is not about guilt over a pizza slice or running miles to burn off a glass of wine.

That is not to say that I YOLO every weekend 😂🙈 I am back into a period of drinking bans and serious training😆😋 But just don't get sucked into thinking that being lean is the best thing in the world.

The odd person gives me the 'you don't know what it's like, you've never been overweight' OR 'sure you've always been fit, you wouldn't understand'. There are so many points I can make to this comment 😡😡😡
.
.
.
1. I may not have ever been over weight because health and fitness have always been a huge part of my life so no weight is something I never struggled with. And the reason I am fit is because I work for it. Not because I am NATURALLY fit. Not because fitness comes easy to me but because I push myself, every day 👊👊👊
.
.
.
2. Body Confidence is a whole different kettle of fish and this is something I can relate to. Being a certain clothes size or having a low body fat % does NOT equate to being happy. I have been 8 stone, a size 6 and seriously unhappy. Like most women I struggled with self image. I would not leave the house without make up. If I ever had to buy clothes in more than an 8 I considered myself fat 🙊😩😭 Do not think just because someone is slim that they are happy or confident because the 2 just do not go hand in hand 🙄🙄. .
.
.
3. And no I've never had to lose weight but dya know what I did have to gain weight. 2 stone to be precise. Mostly muscle, a little fat. Not everyone's journey is the same. Sometimes it's just as important to gain weight as it is to lose it. But truth be told I am the happiest I have ever been with my body 😍 I fuel it well. I eat LOADS, mostly nutritious wholefoods, the odd time junk food 🤗 I train hard, I am strong, I am fit and I am fast. I don't wear make up every day but I feel a million dollars when I do. I have crazy wild curls that I have finally learned to love. I have days that I think I'm fat, days I think I'm too muscly (it's called being a woman 😂) but all in all I'm happy 💖

Next time you think about saying something to someone think about what you are saying. Is it beneficial to the person? Is it a nice thing to say? Is it necessary?

Remember, if you have nothing nice to say. Don't say it at all 😑

I think maybe because I've really started to look after myself, relax myself and do well for myself I'm even more sad because he can't experience that with me. But last week I found 2 white feathers.

21,2018-05-26T16:53:21+0000,"Top tips for eating on the go 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️ Most days I'm gone from 5-22 so I understand how important it is to have good options on the go. I tend to bring all my food with me but sometimes I need to buy out 🙊

1. The best you will be prepared is when you make the food yourself. Knowing exactly what is going into your food. This is key but more often than not we end up having to buy out. Thankfully there are so many healthy options these days 😍👌 2. Structure your meal around protein. If it is from a salad counter pick a good quality meat/fish, tins of tuna are great, these tuna packs from @johnwestire taste AWESOME 😍 You may find a protein shake handy or even some Greek yogurt
Protein rich foods keep us fuller for longer and have a higher thermic effect from food. No matter what your goals are having a diet high in protein will be beneficial regardless 👌

3. Try not to go for seriously long periods without food as we tend to get over hungry and pick the worst options I. É takeaways and junk food

4. Be careful of certain 'health foods' as their sugar content is often through the roof 🙈 Choose snacks like nuts, seeds, yogurt, fruit and veggies 🙋‍♀️ There are now so many healthy convenience foods that there is really never any excuse to eat badly on the go 👌👌👌 #healthylifestyle #healthyeatingonthego #balancedlifestyle #healthyliving #fitliving #fitlifestyle #eatforhealth #eatforperformance #fitgirl #fitchick #fitfam #irishfitfam",52,2,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/32809414_178635012845759_3930072427924553728_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=lPeZ68bUmYMAX-xycKZ&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfBMB7UYuGldUAt4EkYM37Ovg_LRZY0o4bo5npCLnb-1lg&oe=63D93A54,https://www.instagram.com/p/BjP4CvuFMsU/,17922420838184181,,"[{'timestamp': '2018-05-27T09:36:35+0000', 'text': '@ashmcq1990', 'username': 'caoimh7', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '17848512094270875'}, {'timestamp': '2018-05-26T17:13:54+0000', 'text': '#killinit 💪🏽', 'username': 'mattwest_roadtoaesthetics', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '17848358962265338'}]",,

While I can't say I'll ever be the person to relax 100% I'm certainly not the stressed out Sheila I used to be 🙈 I have learned to enjoy my time off. I have seen more places and made more memories in the last 2 and a half years than I have in my entire life (no joke) 😲😲😲 I have ticked bucket list adventures off. I have spent time with friends and family ❤️ And it's only May yet 😉😁🌞 Still lots more to come.

I've also changed my mindset. I used to want to be a certain body fat. Or hit a certain amount of pull ups. Chasing abs. My ideals have changed so much.
My mindset now: I have fat but not that much. I can do a pull up, go mé. I may not have a 6 pack but dya know what I've good legs. Confidence (not Cockiness) is the most amazing trait. Embrace it 💓

I reckon sometimes we see the 'healthier' option and over consume it. Remember, we can over consume 'healthier' foods too 🙈 And what would make it 'healthier'. Let's be honest, all the above products are processed. All the above products have carbohydrates, fats and protein in them?? Let's be clear on one thing. When buying foods, you need to take your goals into consideration. My goals will be a hell of a lot different to someone looking to lose weight so why would I eat the same foods? 🙄

Anyway long story short. These 3 products are not all that different. Per 100g their calories are pretty similar, their protein content virtually identical and carbohydrate content is similar. The main difference being fibre content of products.

I've heard people pick the 'Buckwheat pasta' because it's healthy. The same people will smother that 'healthy' pasta with cream and bacon 😩😩😳😳 P. S be more cautious of the sauces you are having with the pasta 😂😉 #healthylifestyle #healthyalternative #whichisbetter #dependsonyourgoals #healthyliving #fitliving #fitchick #balancedlifestyle #fitfam #irishfitfam",62,5,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/32359145_902092346628877_7343087340950126592_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=VUNPJVTl180AX8AxCeh&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfCrBlq_XTwnwoyJOArdU46aCnqW1vsXPmTDTF8CVdBbcw&oe=63D7C28E,https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi81bLvF-t0/,17931978712118603,,"[{'timestamp': '2018-05-19T12:40:45+0000', 'text': 'Do you consider pasta processed?🤔', 'username': 'pharrellclaire', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2018-05-19T13:15:56+0000', 'text': ""@cleanandleansportygirl ok guess it's never something I had considered as processed!"", 'username': 'pharrellclaire', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '17919509305131160'}, {'timestamp': '2018-05-19T13:13:38+0000', 'text': ""@pharrellclaire well it is Claire.

Complaining about not being able to afford a designer bag, fancy holiday or new car are not important 👎 Having abs is not important and quite frankly is not worth it in my opinion. A size in clothes or a specific weight are absolutely irrelevant if you are healthy and happy. 
For me, carrying a few knocks has meant I have to rest ALOT 😭 I understand it is only temporary and I am lucky to be even able to exercise regularly. It makes me question why those who can chose not to 😭 Anyway that's my view on it. Everyone else's is different. 😑🤗 Just remember what is important in life.

4,2018-05-11T09:45:19+0000,"What is health??? Some will say a 'normal' BMI, others will say a good diet, exercise daily, don't smoke, no alcohol, being free from disease.

Others get more in depth. You need to see visible abs in order to be a healthy weight. Or you need to train until you feel like collapsing. High cárb/low fat or low cárb/high fat. Green tea. Green shakes. Kale. Chia seeds. More weights. More cardio.

My idea of health:
👉 THAT EAR TO EAR SMILE 😍😍😍
👉 Seeing my sister for the first time in 18 months and being ABLE to go to visit her and take the holiday of a lifetime because I am fit and able
👉 Having a beer in my hand because dya know what? I was on holidays and I bloody well deserved a beer
👉 Being happy and confident in my body. Not worrying that my bottoms were too small and I had rolls
👉 ENJOYING my life. Nourishing my body but eating out if I want it. Exercising because I love it and appreciate how lucky I am to be able ❤️ Everyone's idea of health is different. Health to me is not:
❌ Starving yourself to achieve the perfect body. Nobody is perfect. Embrace your flaws.
❌ Exercising as punishment
❌ Missing out on life
❌ Running down people's lifestyle choices. If you want to go out every weekend, your choice. If you don't want to drink or smoke, also your choice.

All dry ingredients in a large bowl. Mix with melted oil, peanut butter and maple syrup. Top with melted dark chocolate and refrigerate ❤️ Plus I didn't wake up with a sugar hangover this morning 🤗 Have an amazing Bank Holiday everyone 🙌❤️ #healthyliving #healthylifestyle

9,2018-05-03T08:42:23+0000,"Morning guys 🤗

So here are some of the snacks I've had this week 😁 I just want to explain to you the difference between healthy foods and calorie control 👌

This is all very goal dependent but you CAN over consume healthy foods. Healthy foods contain calories too and if your calories in are higher than your calories out even though you are eating super healthy you can still gain weight 😬🙄 This picture is 2 different snacks I ate during the week. Both were scrumptious 🤩😍 But the 'healthier' option was double the calories of the alternative. Am I saying don't eat the raw bar? No, absolutely not but be mindful that just because its healthier doesn't mean its lower in calories. My goal is weight maintenance and health. So a little of the healthy stuff is perfect for me with a little fibre one bar here and there because....

10,2018-05-01T06:03:27+0000,"Weight loss or weight maintenance is relatively simple. Overall weekly calories in are less than calories out. 🤗😄 It is that simple. Unfortunately people like to overcomplicate situations 🙄🤐 So Monday to Friday you have cut out bread, dairy, refined sugars, processed foods. The worst thing to touch your lips is a protein bar or piece of fruit. Then the weekend comes and you're out on the lash, takeaway the following day washed down with a coke. Sound familiar?

Guys, you are kidding yourselves 😵😵I am not saying you can never go out or have takeaways but weekends count. They are not a free for all. They account for almost 30% of your week 🙈 
Stop over analysing it.
👉 Eat well Monday - Sunday
👉 Enjoy your treats but keep goals in mind
👉 Move daily
👉 Alcohol in moderation
👉 Drink at least 2 litres of water a day

It's not easy but it is simple. Find what suits you 😄

We are constantly trying to please other people. At work we try to please bosses and colleagues. At home we keep a house going, mothers looking after their children, putting our partners happiness ahead of our own. The list goes on....😼😼😼 This week take time out for yourself. It is not selfish, it is necessary. It might be something small like sitting down with a cup of coffee for 10mins or it could be booking the trip of a lifetime. Whatever it is,do it for you💆‍♀️👆You are your own most important asset and you need to prioritise yourself sometimes 😍🤗 Happy Sunday xxx

16,2018-04-18T16:23:10+0000,"👉How to improve pull ups

Firstly, understand pull ups/chin ups are hard. It is not a case of 'Oh I started going to the gym I should now be able to do a pull up' ❌❌❌ I am sharing a few tips that have helped me through the years. And notice that word 'years' because that is how long it took me 😱🙈 👉You need a strong back. Back and biceps are the primary muscles used in this exercise. A strong back is built through exercises like Deadlifts, Rack Pulls, Rows, Pull Downs etc. And go heavy (with correct form and technique of course). 👉 Your body weight and body fat will have an impact. The heavier you are, the heavier you have to lift. The more excess body fat you have, the harder you are to lift. But this does not mean the lighter you are the easier you are to lift. I was once 8 and half stone and could barely bend my elbows left alone pull myself up 😅😅😅You need to have a balance of both. Low body fat and strength 👌 👉Slow eccentrics - jump to the top of the bar and slowly lower yourself down. And repeat. Often. 👉 Ever heard practice makes perfect 👌It definitely applies here. Practice often. You want to get better at something? Once a week is not enough!!!! Happy to hear other tips if anyone wants to let us know how they improved? ❤️ #chinups #Rackpulls #strongback #strongirls #strongwomen #strong #fitliving #fitlifestyle #fitgirl #fitfam #irishfitfam",78,1,VIDEO,FEED,https://video.cdninstagram.com/v/t50.2886-16/30870246_1847934698840484_5381339699425995596_n.mp4?_nc_cat=102&vs=17941018702055525_3614976131&_nc_vs=HBksFQAYJEdPWUsxd0drNFVyVHI1QUdBRXhyLXUteFc2NUtia1lMQUFBRhUAAsgBABUAGCRHRUlOMXdFby1HdjJpU3NIQUc2RnVOUFlvZWdvYmtZTEFBQUYVAgLIAQAoABgAGwGIB3VzZV9vaWwBMRUAACb%2Bn5edwpqaARUCKAJDMywXQEeVYEGJN0wYFGRhc2hfYmFzZWxpbmVfNjQwX3YxEQB16gcA&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=59939d&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InZ0c192b2RfdXJsZ2VuLjY0MC5mZWVkIn0%3D&_nc_ohc=zYjJ4hgcZV0AX_NbinW&_nc_ht=video.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfBaDRZhdwrUvHjXpS4PjEEiZTFGgXjzaLI_Jpc5LxHvsQ&oe=63D3DEEE&_nc_rid=9c90877260,https://www.instagram.com/p/Bht8bsiFO_F/,17914380553142648,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/30079567_427169467708296_5117356368138862592_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=7QY04e6vI3MAX8kEOHB&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfCU1HZCScpNhX01CJcTQj0zPTd5Eh0urR7hDUNZmoh-Tw&oe=63D93562,"[{'timestamp': '2018-04-18T16:36:19+0000', 'text': '😱🔥', 'username': 'saatsia', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '17931482230079988'}]",,

Like it or not, it's the truth 🙈 Are you the type to work seriously hard for a week only to have a few drinks at the weekend which leads you to missing your Monday workout? Or maybe it's a month of hard work and expecting to see instant results!? Sound familiar 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️ If that's the way you want to live your life, setting yourself up for disappointment that's fine. But stop blaming everything else and start looking at the real reason you are not getting results ☝️☝️☝️ My own personal example. On holidays I drank A lot, ate totally off course and exercised once every 2/3 days. Lack of consistency lead to a very bloated, swelled Amanda. I came home, Ate really well, trained every day and then Easter weekend came = chocolate and gin. Result: Same bloated Amanda🐡🐡🐡 Finally the last 2 weeks I have been CONSISTENT. NO ALCOHOL. Back to training 5-6 times a week. Eating well and I eventually feel kinda back to normal 🙋‍♀️😍 Don't expect to see results for a half hearted effort.

👉Drink 3-4L water daily
👉 Combo of field training and weights (just get moving daily)
👉 This week I've decided to take meat from my diet

Let me elaborate. I am not a plant based enthusiast and I am not a meat hater. I don't believe in extremism and this is my opinion so please for those of you who feel the need to go to town on this post, don't. I am simply voicing my opinion and giving my reasons. I don't believe meat causes cancer. Cancer is multi factorial and it is very easy to blame cancer on 1 thing. What about air pollution? What about the tap water we drink? Daily stresses in people's lives? Financial worries? Genetics? Similarly, I don't believe in veganism. I believe if you HAVE TO supplement a diet, it is not substantial. Again, OPINION!!! Why have I decided meat free this week?

1. Meat is hard tó digest. It requires a lot of work by enzymes and makes our gut work harder. My poor gut has had a tough time of it recently so I'm trying to give it a break ❤️
2. Due to mass production, the quality of all food has gone to 💩 (not just meat, plant based foods too,) Unfortunately, meat has been hit one of the worst. So for me, it is absolutely no harm taking a break from that.
3. I can increase micros. Although I don't believe in pure plant based, it is so important to get a good daily dose of fruits and veggies
4. Fish is an excellent source of protein, I feel satisfied and I don't feel I have taken anything away from my diet nutritionally🤗🤗🤗 Anybody else out there try something like this or is pescatarian?

I am back to regular eating habits, drinking at least 3 litres of water and today has been my first rest day. Yet, I feel sluggish and lethargic and it was really getting me down until today.

Today, I read a blog post from a young girl who was taken way before her time. The post really resignated with me. Here I am complaining that I can't see my abs anymore while others out there are dying. Life is way too short to be knit picking over silly little things. I know first hand how fast a life can be taken away and moaning about tiny insignificant details is absolutely absurd ❌❌❌❌ So I am going to make the most of my weekend❤️ I am catching up with friends, playing a match, enjoying a night out or 2😉 and coaching at my first ever championship game with the u14 team I am involved with. I will eat like normal with  a little Easter egg here and there😉 And I'll stop worrying about the silly stupid irrelevant things 🤗

I'm sure I'm not the only fool out there worrying over the silly stuff. Enjoy your weekend❤️❤️
P.s normality will resume next week. And I still have a video for you🤗

😂😂😂😂 And not 2 f*#ks given. I'm 1/3 alcohol, 1/3 sugar and 1/3 water., cause ya know... Balance 😂 Pictures or words cannot describe the incredible holiday I've had. It was a mental and physical rest from everything in life and it was just amazing 😍Seeing my sister again was the icing on the 🎂but we literally should not be allowed let out together 😂🙈 Normality resumed yesterday when I returned to a training game after 36 hours of no sleep and just a couple of hours off the plane 🤣 I also weaned my way back into healthy eating and enjoyed a 15 hour sleep last night😴

I've said this before and I'll say it again. To me a holiday = a break from normality. Therefore I go all out I eat, I drink and I enjoy myself. I trained 5 times while away as I enjoy training but it was a huge difference to my 5 days a week. BUT not everyone is the same, some people take a total break, some eat really well and don't drink. DO WHAT WORKS FOR YOU!!!! Don't feel guilty because people you follow train while they are away. Don't eat salad if you WANT fries. And if you want the mojiito have it🍸But whatever you do, own it. Don't go feeling guilty about it. Don't give out if you gain weight or retain water. Don't go hiding away. Embrace it nd enjoy it 🧜‍♀️ P. S I have some new body art to show you once my swelling goes down and I look like a normal human again 🤣🤣🤣

.
.
You want to
👉 Mobilise joints
👉 Activate muscle groups
👉 Improve elasticity/flexibility
.
.
Your warm up should mimic your workout, using muscle groups you will be training. Today I trained fullbody so this was just a snippet of my warm up and it hit various muscle groups.
.
.
Warm up inclued:
👉 Inchworms with push up
👉 OH Squat
👉 Lunges
👉 Glute Bridges (Single and double leg)
👉 Deadbugs
👉 Bear Crawl (Forward and Reverse)
👉 Lateral Crawl

20,2018-02-23T18:03:30+0000,"So let's get one thing straight there's nothing 'lucky' to weight loss or a lean physique. ❌People don't lose 2 stone by chance.
❌People don't have visible abs through a poor lifestyle (apart from the minute few genetically gifted people)
.
.
Weight loss is hard. Weight maintenance is even harder.
⚠️ It requires discipline ⚠️ It requires HARD WORK
⚠️ It is NOT EASY - if it's easy you're A. Not doing it right or B. Not going to achieve your goals
⚠️ It takes time
⚠️ Patience is ESSENTIAL
⚠️ You need certain qualities ⚠️ You need to understand the harsh truth. ⚠️ You need to stop making excuses
.
.
If and when you give up on your excuses, you will start seeing results 🤘 And guess what you might even enjoy it👊👊👊
.
.
I'm not a big fan of scale numbers but here are some numbers I consider important
👉 1st January - Last time I had a takeaway
👉 8 weeks ago - Last time I drank (bar a Baileys coffee last week 🙈)
👉 5 days a week - frequency of my training
👉 110kg - my max Deadlift
👉 24/7 - My lifestyle
.
.
I don't feel deprived (apart from the start of the week when I tried to 'diet' and failed miserably 🤣🤣🤣 I LOVE my lifestyle. I do this for me. I do this for my health. I do this for my sport. I do this for energy. .
.
I understand it's not for everybody. Not everyone cares about themselves unfortunately. But I do.

.
.
When I was younger I put my hand up for everything (quote from my Dad🤣). Athletics, Badminton, Cross country,  Draughts, Egg and spoon race I'd say I could do the alphabet of what I tried 🙈 And I was absolutely CRAP at every single one of them 🙈🤣 Like really crap. And to make matters worse, my sister was a little superstar. She had an all Ireland medal at 7, she played football with the boys she was just super talented 😍 Still is 💓 
I never started on any team, I was always picked last. One time, I actually had to give my football boots to another player because she forgot hers (this other player was no superstar either, I was just that poor). The one thing I did have was a good attitude, a great one actually. I never let it get me down. I always still kept with it, probably more for the social side to be honest 😂🙈 .
.
But I kept with it. Even though I was hopeless. I kept training. Then I trained harder. Then I trained harder than everyone else. Then I became fit, fitter than a lot of people. Then, I started going to the gym and I became stronger. Stronger than most. .
.
So now, with a good attitude and a decent level of fitness. I started to make All Ireland winning schools teams, Roscommon panels, UCD O Connor panels and last year made my first ever Connaught panel 🤗😁 I still have a fear of the goals and my overhead catch is crap but I'm an athlete. What I always wanted to be. Never give up on something because of the hard work it will take to get there, the time will pass anyway 👌
.
.
Hard Work beats talent, when talent doesn't work hard 👊👊👊

.
P.s I'm not chickening out on my video instas I will have one very soon 😉

I'm going to hit you with a few home truths. 🙈🙈🙈 People take it easy on themselves. People use excuses. People take short cuts. People have no patience. People reward themselves far too easily ❌❌❌ If you want a change, you need to make a change. It will take sacrifice. Sacrifice isn't easy. 👊

Scenario 1: You want to lose weight. But you're not making any sacrifices = you will get nowhere. It doesn't have to something crazy like go gluten free or vegan. Something as simple as removing your 11 o clock chocolate break daily will lead to results 😁 You NEED to make a sacrifice to reap the rewards. If you keep doing qhat you've always done, you'll keep getting what you always got 🙈The truth hurts 👊

Scenario 2: You want to get fitter, stronger, leaner. But you're just not putting in the effort. It's not easy being fit. You don't just wake up lean (unless you are one of the lucky ones or are u18). Strength doesn't grow on trees. You need to work at it. You need to consistently fight for it. 
In anything you do, unless you make a sacrifice you will not see results 🙈

My own fitness story: I worked at it. I made myself sick once from training so hard. Then I decided to nourish my body. As soon as I did that I started to see results- performance and aesthetic wise. It wasn't easy. Ever. But I'm driven and I have goals to achieve. I'm not an excuse maker. I start most of my days at 5am and finish close to 10pm but I make it work. Because my health is my driver. Health is more important to me than excuses 👊👏😁 #sacrifice #hardwork #workhard #playhard #fitliving #fitlifestyle #fitchick #fuelforperformance #fuelyourself #healthyliving #fitfam #irishfitfam",63,7,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/27580806_1619491828133406_8328581287963000832_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=6ldbzD92le0AX9TXbDl&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfDYUKB1rlA2ck8MlKv08_qjS5A4ovRDE23RQJiJ9GX9hg&oe=63D81F65,https://www.instagram.com/p/BfIfK3THUT5/,17911904221113409,,"[{'timestamp': '2018-02-15T08:35:06+0000', 'text': 'Well said gal!!!

.
.
Ok, so this is a really important post and I need you all to listen up.
.
.
In order to understand what you need to eat and why, in order to eat for your goals, in order to get optimal body composition, in order to get the best from your body performance wise, you need to stop looking up the foods people eat and invest in a nutrition plan/nutritionist/coach etc.
.
.
Why?
- Firstly, every single one of you are different. So why would you all eat the same? Everyone has different schedules. Everyone has different training plans. You are all different weights and heights so why would you all eat the same. Social media is RIDICULOUS at times comparing whole nutritious foods to fast foods just because they are the same calories. People who are not as knowledgable will see this and think 'oh it's ok then to have fast food all the time because it's the same calories' 🙈🙈🙈 NO NO NO!! It is ok to eat these foods once in awhile with a balanced diet but you cannot just say 'It fits your macros, therefore you can have it'. People pick up these nuggets of information, use them and don't see results, why? Because they didn't use them properly and over induldged in these foods. It is essential to understand how you can have these things in moderation but you will only get that through a nutritionist. - Secondly, let's be straight here. If you are a normal person training 3 times a week, looking to lose weight and body fat, your diet DOES not need to be the same as an athletes training 5-6 times a week. For so many reasons. 1. Athletes require more carbs - it is essential fuel for sport. 2. Athletes body compositions are different so their BMR is higher and they need more food. 3. Their emphasis is on performance not aesthetics and the list goes on.

Obviously, I am both a nutritionist and an athlete so this area is hugely important to me. If you have any questions on this comment below or even drop me a DM I'm happy to help 🤗

10,2018-01-27T10:32:59+0000,"Heart Rate and Resting Heart Rate

I put up a poll about this and a lot of you wrote to me so I said I'd try explain a little more.

Heart Rate is the speed of the heartbeat measured by the number of contractions of the heart per minute. This can vary according to the body's physical needs including absorbing oxygen and excreting carbon dioxide. A great example is comparing at rest to during physical activity, the demand for oxygen is much higher during exercise than at rest.

Resting heart rate can be affected by exercise, sleep, illness, stress, anxiety and the use of drugs. Normal ranges of RHR are 50-90BPM. Normally, the more cardiovascularly fit you are the lower your RHR. It may be below 60. The lowest ever was achieved by Daniel Green in 2014 with a reading of 26BPM.

Specific heart rate zones are required for specific goals with regard exercise i.e fat burning, cardio and peak.  Your max HR is 220- Age.

I now use this as one of my goals. As I said before my goals are no longer aesthetic based but performance. One of my goals was to get my RHR below 50 ✔

13,2018-01-24T09:42:04+0000,"The million dollar question I seem to be getting asked ALOT recently 🙈🙈🙈 👉Should women or kids be lifting weights?
There is a lot of crap out there on this topic. A lot of myths and some made up crap. You really would be suprised the amount of people I deal with on a daily basis who believe women 'should not be lifting weights' and 'lifting weights stunts your growth'. 👉 I'll deal with these 2 seperately. Kids/Teenagers can do resistance exercise. Bodyweight exercise is vitally important for gaining muscle mass, reducing body fat, mobility, bone strengthening. If you can successfully excute all bodyweight exercises, you're onto a winner. 👉 Is there an age you can start lifting weights? The research suggests that youths can lift weights as long as the reps are high and the weight is light. 👉 Resistance exercise is of VITAL importance to all ages and all genders. It can be in the form of bodyweight or weights but it is necessary for increasing fat free mass. The problem with anyone lifting weights is due to lack of information and incorrect technique. It WILL NOT make you masculine and if anything it emphasises your feminine features 🍑🍑🍑 But get proper knowledge from a trainer. If you care enough about it, invest in it 😍

I can accept a parent concerned about their child who doesn't eat any vegetables and who loves their chocolate and I CAN RELATE🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️ But as for a grown adult who is saying no to all foods, I'm sorry no sympathy. 🙈 Guys, it is habit. One that you have to cop on and break. It is down to you. No one can force you, no one can shove healthy foods down your throat. If you want it enough you will do it, if you don't you'll make excuses 🚫🚫🚫 💕 I used to be constantly sick and run down when I ate badly. I had every infection under the sun.

Annoyingly, you can gain weight from eating too much healthy foods if the calories are high enough and similarly you can lose weight from eating crap if the calories are low enough 😣

👉 This is opinion, not fact.
👉 Whether you hit your macros, nail your calories or not, daily takeaways are not healthy in my eyes. Sure you may look good on the outside but the discomfort of digesting that food is not healthy and not good for you inside.

So I'm going to try to increase my food posts as best as I can and my main aim is to educate you all on a healthier lifestyle 🤞👌 So I've said before that I don't count calories, never have probably never will 🙈 I don't count macros because I have a fair idea what is in food, what I need more of and what I can do better on. I'm not shredded but instead am a healthy weight and most importantly I'm healthy inside and out 👌👊 Remember health is not always about aesthetics 👎👎👎 But I do have a brain and I use it wisely 😋😆 Some of you will hate this, some of you will see the benefit. So I went to the cinema last night, and instead of getting cinema pop corn I opted for a lower calorie option. Propercorn is a fantastic substitute for cinema popcorn if weight loss is a goal. It comes in at just 88Cals compared to our 'SMALL' cinema popcorn at 200-300 Cals (and who ever buys small). I also brought water instead of a fizzy drink. 
Some of you will think for the love of God this is extreme. Others will understand. I don't always opt for the healthy option. I was the first one at Christmas head first in Celebrations but if you want to maintain a healthy lifestyle you need to make changes. Eating crap makes me feel like crap and so in turn I try not to do it. I try to find healthier alternatives that make me feel better but without restricting myself 🤗

Whinging, whining, complaining, bitching, moaning. I have done it all 🙈 One of those weeks where everything that could go wrong did 🙈🤣 But guess what? It's nearly 4pm on Friday meaning I made it through my working week. Not ONCE did I feel like not training someone!! I was tired yes, I was unmotivated but I did it, and I did it well 👊😁 As for training, I have made all my sessions and pushed out every bit of energy 👌💪 So for those who think I am so energetic all the time and so positive. Nope, I'm normal. Have bad days/weeks like everyone 🤣 But tomorrow's a new day 💓

Firstly, a lot of people mistake hunger for thirst. So make sure you are getting in your 2 litres + of water per day. 
If you are still getting cravings, maybe you are deficient in a certain mineral. Take a look at the table above 👆

The purpose of this photo with the aid of a little filter as I am 👻 at the moment 😁 Is to show you how consistency works. So pic 1 is before is before Christmas and pic 2 is after Christmas.

This is literally what I look like year round.
🚫No six pack
🚫 I'm not tensing in these photos
🚫No Crazy quad or shoulder definition
🚫 I don't count calories or macros ✔ I have a very healthy relationship with food

I am fit for purpose. I am an athlete, although the miles are adding to the clock and it's not as easy as it used to be, I still try my hardest. 😥🙈 Please don't be fooled this January by detox teas or meal replacements.

T minus 9 weeks until my hols. What approach am I taking to be bikini ready?
.

👉 Same thing I do day in, day out. Eat well. Move often. Sleep. Hydrate 🤗
.
.
.
There's no secret. It takes time. It takes patience. .
.
.
I've been training consistently for 4 years. I've over trained. I've tried low carb, no carb, gluten free, refined sugar free. I've made mistakes and learned from them. .
.
.
Find what is sustainable. Find exercise you enjoy. And be patient. It won't happen overnight, it may take a year or more. But when you are comfortable and confident year round, you know you have struck gold🎖Your body is your most important asset.
