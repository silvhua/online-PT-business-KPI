If you're a female who wants to be bikini confident year round in 12 weeks, then now is your last chance to apply. 

I'd hate for you to miss out on results like these:

- Aoibheann lost 5kg in 12 weeks
- Sarah is now benching her old 1RM for 10 reps
- Trish lost inches and kilos while looking after her 2 kids

So - the decision is up to you, and it's super easy to apply.

But there are only a few hours left to apply.

‼️I'm looking for 5 ladies who want to become strong and confident while eating the foods they enjoy‼️
.
.
Feel like you've tried everything and still see no results? Here's 3 reasons my coaching programme could work for you: 

1. I educate women on nutrition. I don't give meal plans but actually teach you the importance of nutrient dense food. I help you calculate calories and understand the foods you need to fuel your body. I'm also a big advocate of including foods you actually enjoy! 

2. Want to be able to lift your suitcase with ease when lockdown finishes? Want to perform a push up? Want to become a strong, independent female?
I focus on resistance training and encourage women to become the strongest they can be. 

3. I help women become the best versions of themselves. Confidence comes from the inside out and I help women find that sassy female that's hiding inside. 

I know sometimes people are afraid to make a long term commitment so this kickstarter may be exactly what you need to start your health and fitness journey with me. Did I also mention the incredible community that comes with it? 

When does it start?
Monday 6th September.
