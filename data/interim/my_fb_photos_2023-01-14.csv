When I finished university years ago, what helped me start my career was speaking to professionals in the industry and continuing to learn. I’m back to that process, this time in a new field. If you can give me some insight to help guide my career exploration, please let me know!

While I would love a data scientist or machine learning role, I’m aware that these positions are usually given to those with more direct experience.

I'm actually a fan of Apple Health. I use it to track my sleep and steps. Women can also track menstrual cycle and related symptoms, which is helpful. Apple Health also integrates with many other apps/wearables so you can see your data on a single platform.

More recently, the sharing feature allows me to monitor my parents' data, including data related to risk of falls.

The data scientist in me wishes their interface had more data visualization and analysis features, but it's still pretty good for built-in free app.

6,2023-01-03T20:34:34+0000,"Gamify your goals

Duolingo was one of the pioneers in the gamification space. I started using it last year to improve my Chinese and French. For me, the app's most powerful feature is its streak count because:

1. I don't want to miss a day of lessons because I'll lose my streak.

2. At the same time, I have 1 or 2  banked ""streak freezes"" so I can keep my streak even if I miss a day (you need to earn or purchase the streak freezes).

This approach is great because it is process-oriented (e.g. do this habit) rather than outcome-oriented (e.g. lose weight), which has been shown scientifically to be better for long term adherence.

You don't any app to ""gamify"" a habit you want to add. Crossing off days on a calendar will work equally if not better (the more this reminder is in plain sight, the better). If you like crossing items off a to-do list, add the habit there (I love Asana and Notion for managing tasks).

What gamification strategies do you have?

I just lost my 170+ day Duolingo streak because I missed my lesson on New Year's Eve of all days. I guess the new year really IS a fresh start for me.",10104322209175171

7,2022-01-12T00:35:00+0000,"Get Over the Fear: How to Do Your First Handstand Hold (video linked in the comments)

The wall-facing handstand is basically an advanced plank! It does emphasize shoulder stability more than the standard plank.

These are the benefits of handstands, even if you have a desk job:
• They train your core and glutes to support a healthy back.
• They help you maintain good posture: To do a handstand, you need adequate overhead mobility and thoracic mobility, which we don't tend to challenge enough in our day to day activities (use it or lose it!).
• They strengthen the muscles that help improve posture and keep your shoulders pain-free, such as the rotator cuff, serratus anterior, and lower trapezius. 

Steps:
1. Keep your abs tight as you walk your hands and feet up into the handstand position.
2. As you hold, push the floor away from to keep your shoulder muscles active.
3. Ensure good core stability by keeping your ribs pulled towards your spine. In other words, maintain a good hollow body position. The muscles of the butt and front of the thighs should also be tense, not just the upper body and core.
4. While the goal is to bring your hands as close to the wall as you can, start in a more horizontal position if needed and gradually work towards a more vertical position as you improve strength and stability.
Whatever position you choose, always push the floor away and keep your ribs pulled towards your spine. 

If you give this a try, leave a comment on how this goes for you.",10103975075269301

11,2021-12-23T23:32:48+0000,"Why the scale goes crazy during the holidays: part 2/3.
 
It takes a surplus or deficit of ~3500 calories to gain or lose a pound of fat, which is more than what your average person consumes on an average day. Here are some explanations for large weight fluctuations that have nothing to do with true fat or muscle changes, but rather to do eating differently than normal during celebrations:
- Higher food residue in the digestive tract due to higher fibre intake.
- If you're constipated due to eating stuff you're not used to (like we did at the Indian buffet pictured), the food remaining in your gut will also add weight.
- Less time between the last meal and when you weigh yourself from late night eating.
 
What's the largest weight fluctuation you've experienced from one day to another, and why did that happen? I once did some targeted food, hydration, and salt manipulation to reduce my scale weight by 3 kg in 1 week for a lifting competition. It had nothing to do with fat loss.
 
In part 3, I'll go over some reasons for weight fluctuations that are neither due to fat gain nor diet.",10103961904044541

Do you get emotional (or simply curious) about the number on the scale fluctuating a couple (or more) pounds day to day?
 
It takes a surplus or deficit of ~3500 calories to gain or lose a pound of fat, which is unlikely to happen from a day or two. When we eat much differently than usual (e.g. due to holiday festivities), here are some explanations for large weight fluctuations that have nothing to do with true fat or muscle changes:
- Water retention due to higher salt intake than normal.
- Muscles being fuller with glycogen and water, e.g. due to higher carbohydrate intake. For every gram of carbohydrate stored in the muscle (glycogen), we store 3-4 g of water.
