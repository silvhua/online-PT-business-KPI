Look at this infographic, including the legend. “RT” stands for resistance training (”weight training”, or exercises targetting muscles) and “AT” stands for aerobic training (”cardio”).

Notice that of the 8 categories of exercise benefits, 7 can be obtained from resistance exercise. Only cardiorespiratory function is unique to aerobic training.

Resistance training is essential for strength and preventing age-related muscle and bone loss, yet many exercisers don’t do it. Hopefully infographics such as this one help people learn that resistance training is the most impactful use of their exercise time.

My questions is how much the increasing interest in fitness trackers is from people who are already exercising regularly, people who end up increasing their physical activity/health practices as a result of the device, or people with aspirations of improving fitness but remain sedentary.

More recently, the sharing feature allows me to monitor my parents' data, including data related to risk of falls.

Duolingo was one of the pioneers in the gamification space. I started using it last year to improve my Chinese and French. For me, the app's most powerful feature is its streak count because:

1. I don't want to miss a day of lessons because I'll lose my streak.

2. At the same time, I have 1 or 2  banked ""streak freezes"" so I can keep my streak even if I miss a day (you need to earn or purchase the streak freezes).

This approach is great because it is process-oriented (e.g. do this habit) rather than outcome-oriented (e.g. lose weight), which has been shown scientifically to be better for long term adherence.

You don't any app to ""gamify"" a habit you want to add. Crossing off days on a calendar will work equally if not better (the more this reminder is in plain sight, the better). If you like crossing items off a to-do list, add the habit there (I love Asana and Notion for managing tasks).

A few years ago at the peak of my obsession with optimizing strength training, I used a Polar chest strap for 2 minutes each daily before getting out of bed to track my HRV. It was a bit of hassle as I had to keep a dish of water next to the bed to wet the sensor electrodes to avoid confounding the results by getting up. No surprise, I abandoned that daily measurement (my Oura ring measures HRV effortlessly while I sleep, though strength training is not as central to my life as it was before).

In the fitness space, people get excited about how AI can analyze movement, but what I am most excited about is how to use AI to help people adopt healthier lifestyles--we generally know it's important to exercise, but doing it is challenging.

If Netflix and YouTube can recommend content you'll find interesting, how can a health app recommend a health practice that you'll adopt to improve your health long term?

The recommendation will likely need to account for and adapt to your preferences, personality, knowledge/skills, and life stage. It also must be the right level of difficulty: If it's too challenging, you'll get discouraged and give up. If it's too easy, you might not get much benefit or lose motivation.

When I started my career, I assumed that having knowledge and data were the only important things for being good at my job. It didn’t take too long for me to realize that I could have all the technical knowledge I needed, but it wouldn’t matter if I couldn’t use it to influence people positively.

Scientists and analysts are all experienced with using figures and tables to show data, but even the best don’t necessarily communicate their findings in a way that is easy to interpret and translate. As someone who appreciates good data visualization, these are the points I will think about when I want to communicate more effectively with data:

- The figure title should give the take-home message, not just the topic of the figure.

- Use colours and colour intensity to emphasize the most important lines/points.

- Annotate the figure so the reader can get the important context without reading the caption/text.

A few years ago I decided to focus my professional development on behaviour change. It’s fun to think about this topic from a data science lens.

No; here’s why:
1. The main challenges in fitness relate to getting people to adopt resistance training and continue long term, not simply knowing what to do. A good trainer doesn’t just check form; they help people DO the things that are aligned with their motivations and abilities.

2. Even when computer vision becomes advanced enough to distinguish between subtle differences in exercise technique, differences in muscle activation patterns (which can make the difference between pain vs. no pain) cannot always be be seen, even by an expert coach. A good movement coach knows the right questions and cues to use for the individual in front of them.

What WILL happen is that these AI-based fitness products will:

- Allow more people to exercise smarter.

- Weed out low quality exercise professionals and force remaining ones to up their standards.

- Make it easier for exercisers and fitness professionals to make data-informed decisions through easier data tracking and visualization.

Lifting weights and resistance training are not just just for athletes or people who want to change their appearance; it helps to:

- Increase strength. That way, you can do everyday activities more easily with less pain/injury.
- Counteract muscle imbalances. Most sports and cardio activities (e.g. running, cycling, hiking) inherently train some muscles and not others. A good resistance training program systematically targets the various parts of the body to help you maintain good posture and reduce aches/pains.
- Counteract the effects of ageing: Falls, broken hips, frailty, and stooped posture should not be accepted as inevitable.

I will have 2 weeks starting Nov 24 to work on a final project that involves machine learning (a subset of artificial intelligence). More data = more accurate predictions.

The goal of this project is to create an algorithm that can tell you how much weight to lift for the prescribed number of reps, desired effort level (reps in reserve), and your attributes. Here's why:
1. The charts/formulas based %1RM have a lot of error; they are based on population averages and may not apply to you as an individual. Let's find an estimate that is more accurate for YOU.
2. We need a way to select an appropriate weight even without recent 1RM testing.

For simplicity, I am collecting data only on the barbell squat. Front squat, back squat, and zercher squats are included as long as the data provided are all for the same exercise. Here's my request:
1. Look at your training log and fill in the following Google form. My algorithm will require a rating of effort based on reps in reserved (RIR). If you don't track your reps in reserve, do it on your next squat session and come back! You can submit anonymously.
2. Share this with your lifting friends! The more data I have, the more accurate the predictions will be.

Rep max estimation equations exist, but usually have a lot of error for any given individual and/or circumstances. It would be amazing to have a machine learning model that can estimate YOUR rep max given YOUR previously-logged reps/sets, RPE/RIR, and even whether it's a regular training session or a session you've peaked for. 

My questions are:
 1. Does this type of app/algorithm already exist? I am pretty sure most just use the basic static equations.
 2. If not, I would LOVE to create this. The trouble would be getting enough data of training logs in order to sufficiently train and tune the model. Any ideas where I could go about getting adequate data for this purpose? 

I don't think looking at powerlifting/weightlifting competition results would the best data because:
 1. Most people don't train using maximal weight to failure most of the time (I envision a model that updates its estimations weekly). I want this algorithm to help people determine the right weight to use no matter what rep range, i.e. it should be able to estimate 1-15+ rep max.
 2. Repeated frequent data would be required so you won't have to do max testing for accurate rep max estimations.
