.
.
Note: This is not a standard pyramid, and is totally subjective😁
.
.
Diet is defined as the kinds of food a person habitually eats. No diet will ever be successful if someone cannot successfully stick to it and be consistent with it. And for this reason, it is my bread and butter. It is the most important element when it comes to nutrition. No matter what meal plan you’re given, calories allotted to you or macro breakdowns - if you can’t stick to it - you’re fighting a losing battle! 
.
.
I am a nutritionist so Food Quality is my next most important element. I know in terms of energy balance it is as simple as calories in versus calories out but I just cannot educate people and say that Food quality doesn't matter. If I didn't care about my clients and I just cared about transformation photos I could give someone a calorie calculator and say 'Here once it's within your calories it doesn't matter what the meals include'. Maybe not for body composition (questionable) but certainly for long term health 🤦‍♀️
.
.
Then, I put calories. Calories do matter but to me food quality matters more. As I've said, this is opinion. At the end of the day, it is an energy balance equation so I can't disregard them but mfp and calorie trackers are not always 100% accurate so don’t expect all readings to be gospel. They are a measure like everything else.
.
.
Technically that should be macronutrients but I'm putting protein as the king 🤴 Although I do feel very strongly about good balance so please don't disregard carbs and fats 😬
.
.
Lastly, comes supplements. Supplements should always be an addition. Until you have everything else nailed, don’t worry too much about them!

Did I miss anything 🤔

This may sound dramatic but it’s 110% true. And let me tell you why?

When Owen and I first got together, I had gained a little weight from general college life and drinking too much. I was by no means overweight but the way I talked about myself you’d think I was obese. I distinctly remember buying fat burning supplements (I couldn’t afford the good stuff so I opted for the cheaper option and thought the cheap stuff wasn’t working). My birthday was coming up and because I had been CONSTANTLY talking about ‘my belly’ Owen suggested buying me a Wondercore Smart (please google). I stopped talking to him! I was FUMING! 

You see poor Owen did absolutely nothing wrong! He saw I had a problem, he offered the solution (ps A wondercore smart is NOT the solution - but we were young and naive).

I was the problem. I had no energy because I was starving myself, then binging. I was moody because I was craving chocolate all the time. I was tired because I was running daily! 

How I felt about myself - caused me to be negative and dismissive of my partner who just wanted to see me happy 🥹☹️ 

I’ll NEVER forget that while we now make jokes about it, over our movie nights with chocolate and crisps on a rest day because I now need and understand my body ♥️

✅ Mother 
✅ Radiographer

originally signed up to lose weight, tone up and gain more energy and vitality 🙌

She was actually in physical pain from lack of activity and she would need a nap during the day as she was just so tired. 

Something she really wanted was to ‘feel better wearing outfits’ and just last week she told me ‘her body is looking and feeling strong 💪’.

Devani had tried MANY programmes before my Strong and Sassy programme and struggled to keep consistent with them and always fell if the wagon 🥺 But the slow habits based approach is exactly what she needed along with 20 minute training sessions. She’s finally found a lifestyle she can adhere to ♥️🙌

Did I mention - she also resigned after her original programme 🙌🙏

1. Let’s start with how fat loss will help with chin ups. A higher lean muscle mass and a lower body fat mass is the optimal body composition 🙏 By Deirdre, dropping some body fat, it made it easier to pull herself up

2. Strength - a chin up is a REALLY difficult movement. You need to be working on your strength consistently to even be within earshot of achieving one. 

3. Progressive programme geared towards goal. If you’re doing back exercises and chin ups once a week, it’s going to be incredibly hard to achieve a chin up! Frequency matters and having a programme geared TOWARDS that goal - makes it fool proof! 

4. Nutrition - train hard, recover HARDER 💪 Eating an adequate amount of food, good quality food and ensuring you’re recovering properly is KEY to achieving goals.

✅ Working Full time
✅ Mum
✅ Studying Part time

Lisa came to me with the goals of getting fitter and stronger. She wanted to be more confident within herself and wanted her independence back. Lisa had every excuse NOT to look after herself first. She is a busy working mum, studying part time AND she’s had previous injuries! 

Lisa soon realised she needed to attend to her own oxygen mask first and stop neglecting herself. Lisa described her attempts at a healthier lifestyle as ‘Ground hog day’ before she made the plunge to join the Strong and Sassy programme.

In the short time she’s been doing the programme. She’s realised:
✅ The programme is tailored individually to her
✅ Works on a much slower pace than most programmes
✅ Builds sustainable habits
✅ Builds not just a stronger body but a more resilient mind.

Fat gets a bad rep. 
Sure it is 9Kcal per gram but it is an essential part of a balanced fat. 
.
.
Fats provide us with energy, makes up our cell membranes of our brain and nervous system. Fats are necessary to transport vitamins A,D,E and K and make and balance certain hormones.
.
.
Dietary Fat can be found in 2 forms:
Saturated – mainly found in animal products like meat, dairy, eggs, coconut
Unsaturated – found in marine sources like fish oils, as well as nuts, seeds and vegetable oils
.
. 
For years saturated fat was thought to be associated with higher risk of Cardiovascular Disease and so it was deemed as ‘unhealthy’ or ‘bad for you’. The problem with saturated fat was not the actual fat itself but rather the increased consumption of processed food or the large quantities of saturated fat products. Saturated fat helps increase the cholesterol production in the body which is an essential part of metabolism and in the production of steroid hormones. So saturated fat should feature in our diet, just maybe don’t latter every meal in butter.
.
. 
Unsaturated fats are made up of mono and polyunsaturated fats.  These contain our omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids. Omega 3 fatty acids open our airways and blood vessels. They reduce our blood lipids and cholesterol and lower inflammation and pain. Omega 6 fatty acids do the opposite. Both are needed in the body, without both we wouldn’t heal or recover from exercise. The problem with Western diets is that we don’t have the proper ratios. We are at about 10:1 where we should be at 2:1 (omega 6/omega 3).

Low fat diets were a fad a few years ago. While people reduced calories, they increased their intake of processed foods. Diets lacked fats and fat soluble vitamins so instead of being healthier people were losing weight but were not healthier.
.
. 
Fats are an essential part of any healthy diet. Be aware that they are very calorie dense so portion control may be important and don’t opt for processed versions. Enjoy them as part of a balanced lifestyle.

Ask ANY person who’s had a SUCCESSFUL weight loss journey (not a 6 week challenge - where they’ve lost 5kg but put it all back on). I’m talking about someone who has successfully lost weight and KEPT it off.

Ask them - how did they do it? 

Ask them - was it really about the weight?

Ask them - how have they sustained it? 

You’re right - I’ve never had to lose weight. But that doesn’t mean I haven’t had a transformation of my own.

If you ask someone who has successfully achieved a weight loss goal - they will tell you a lot of it is a change in mindset. A change in how you view food and exercise. They’ll tell you - the weight was never actually the problem, it was how they felt within that body that was the problem. And they’ll tell you they sustained it by adhering to the process not the end goal, by changing their habits to support their new lifestyle.

Well guess what I have done all of the above 👆 

How you feel about yourself within the body you’re in - can be changed! Your relationship with food - can be healed! You can transform your ‘bad’ habits into good ones!

You just have to be willing to take the first step 🙏♥️",40,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/328697230_711696557283675_2410076007337057778_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=OU9yMDh074UAX_KnMmW&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfBF76H8azQ2c6w3CS2jqggejzYOLUCrATTLSSaRTA54ig&oe=640458FD,https://www.instagram.com/p/CosaR9xh3AN/,17974787108095584,,,,

Carbohydrates are our main energy source for body and brain 🧠 

Don’t neglect them. 

If you’re participating in sport - you need more than the average person.

But the average person still needs approximately 200-300g (depending on a lot of different factors).

One reason people lose weight when they go low or no carb is because for every gram of carbohydrate you consume - you store 3-4g water. Don’t confuse weight for fat - they are two totally different things.

I do however have a bone to pick with carbs - too often we overconsume on them and neglect our other macronutrients like protein and fat. So make sure you have a good balanced approach to your nutrition 🙏

Remember, the best nutrition approach is the sustainable one - if you think you can cut carbs FORVER - go ahead with it. But enjoy feeling tired, sluggish and under recovered 😬 If you’re team carbs - great choice 🙌

17,2023-02-08 05:43:05+11:00,"Here’s some of the many reasons you’re NOT making a change - let’s discuss some of the best options to overcome these obstacles 🙌

➡️ Time - I hate when people say we have the same 24 hours in a day. Because this statement isn’t really true. My 24 hours as an online coach are very different from my clients who work full time and have 3 kids. BUT quite often - there is a little bit of time we can utilise - perhaps it’s when the kids are gone to school or getting up an hour earlier 2 days a week, maybe it’s sacrificing an episode of Netflix in the evening. If you actually sit down and prioritise it - you can MAKE it work.

➡️ Money - there’s a lot of things we can do to save us some money. Batch cooking is a great way to save 💵 Also, check out the super 6 in supermarkets - they’re a great way to get fresh food on sale. Lastly, take a look at your weekends. If you’re spending over €100 or $200 on alcohol and nights out but complaining you can’t put money into your health - there’s a bit of an imbalance 🤔

➡️ Environment is everything 🙌 I know it’s much easier for me to eat healthy because it’s majority healthy food in my house. The gym I go to is walking distance so I’ve made the environment easier 🙌 The people I surround myself with are interested in fitness, don’t go out partying every weekend and have the same values as me. My environment is perfect. Is yours? 🤔

➡️ Have a plan and stick to it instead of relying on motivation. If motivation is your biggest problem - I suggest getting accountability and support.

➡️ ‘Bad’ Habits - learn to change habits one at a time instead of 7 million things at once. It’s a lot more achievable! 

➡️ Lack of discipline and self belief - maybe things haven’t worked for you in the past. Maybe you have a sour taste in your mouth 👄 That doesn’t mean it can’t work again! Commit to the process 🙏",12,0,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/329285774_597626205516010_3279580676861430971_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=hQ2N1LnIM0gAX-feMXO&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfB35k-ozfeooQQ7fH8BJLs9VrnGqFXH90MqFeTVU9_NgQ&oe=64046232,https://www.instagram.com/p/CoXyRn5BmtR/,18002212681606867,,,,

It brought me right back to 10 years ago, going on a girls holiday with a group of friends and being insanely unhappy in my body and extremely self conscious 😞

Ladies, I need you to know - that feeling is NOT ok. 

❌It’s not ok to feel unhappy in your body. 
❌It’s not ok to pick apart your body and critiquing it in the mirror.
❌It’s not normal to constantly diet before getting in a bikini. 

We have ONE body to live in. You have to love it. You have to embrace it. Keep it safe. Protect it like your life depends on it - because guess what it does! 

If this hit a nerve - remember this is ALL within your control, you have the power to change how you feel ♥️ You just need to take control 💪

I always harp on about education being one of the main focuses of my Strong and Sassy programme - so here’s the proof 🙏

I asked Zsofi to put this together as I think it’s important to hear from my clients and their success stories as opposed to always hearing from me.

1,2023-01-30 06:18:12+11:00,"A common misconception about my coaching…

I adapt training programmes to the individual. Careful consideration is taken into account based on:
✔️ Home life - do they have kids? Will they have time to go to a gym? Is home training a better option? Maybe budget is a consideration?

✔️ Training Level - I don’t have 1 Client who trains like me - I want to make that clear. Majority of my clients are beginner to intermediate level looking to get stronger and feel better in their clothes 😍 I programme the best style of training to suit those goals. 
P.s CrossFit is not the most optimal style of training for aesthetics 🫣

✔️ Goals - not all goals are the same - therefore not all programmes are the same 🙌💪 

✔️ Time - Time to commit to training is HUGE. Over shoot the runway here and you’re feeling deflated and like a failure. For example - if I have a client who’s never trained before - I’m not gonna give them a 5 day a week - 60 minute programme. We ween our way in with shorter, less frequent training. 
NOTE: Majority of my clients train 3 times a week 45-60 mins a day! Some less, some more. Depending on what THEY can commit! 

Ok, now I’ve told you about my training programmes - let me tell you - the training side of my programme is actually the TINIEST part and probably the most insignificant if I’m honest 🫣 The real beauty lies in the nutrition and mindset work 💪

What you see:
✅ A girl who loves exercise - possibly even obsessed 
✅ A person who is motivated
✅ A physically strong female
✅ Someone who eats really well
✅ Not a big partier 
✅ Has time to train 6 times a week

What I see:
✅ A rock solid mindset 
✅ Someone who is disciplined 
✅ A physically and mentally strong female
✅ Someone who nourishes and fuels her body
✅ The most extrovert, social butterfly you’ll ever meet - but doesn’t prioritise partying
✅ Commits to training 6 times a week

Mindset - one of the most important elements to any health and fitness journey. Perspective changes based on the person - we all know the glass half empty/half full example.

If you’re eating well and doing physical exercise but not prioritising your mental exercise - I can promise you what you’re doing is not sustainable in the long term!

Creatine is one of the most vastly researched supplements and has been promoted in the fitness industry in the last few years. According to research, supplementation with creatine monohydrate has been shown to increase Skeletal muscle mass, lean body mass and muscle fibre size. Research also suggests past this and it may encourage healthy aging and benefit brain health. 

𝐃𝐨 𝐈 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐞?
Creatine supplementation can be hugely beneficial for athletic performance and studies have also showed it can have an impact on body composition (prolonged creatine ingestion inducing an increase in fat free mass). 

𝐃𝐨 𝐈 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐞?
Nope. 5g daily will suffice. (The idea to saturate the muscle is just to experience benefits sooner).
Increase water consumption when you start taking creatine.

Evidence does suggest post workout is superior to pre workout.

- Bloating - This is due to the muscles absorbing the water with the Creatine. Very common and usually subsides when the muscles are saturated.
- Stomach discomfort - May cause stomach sensitivity like bloating.

1. Being consistently good is better than being occasionally perfect.

2. The weekend makes up a large part of the week. If you think you’re being good during the week and not making progress - take a look at your weekends.

3. Sleep is one of the most underestimated tools to help you achieve ANY goal. If you’re sleep is shit and you’re sacrificing it ‘to seize the morning’ and train at 6am - you may be doing more harm than good.

4. Water consumption is the simplest way to becoming a healthier version of yourself. Stop looking at fad diets, detox teas, apple cider vinegar and look at your hydration status. Dehydration affects every system in our body and can lead to lack of energy, low mood, injury and brain fog (to mention afew).

5. Human connection, vitamin D and exercise are some of the most under utilised mental health prescriptions. Try increase all of these on the daily to see an instant mood shift 🙏

6. Stop trying to be a people pleaser and learn to say no - you are your own most important asset. 

7. Live every day like it’s your last ❤️ Do what makes you happy!

👉 Instead of spending hours watching the ‘calories you’re burning’ why not swap for getting stronger instead 💪

👉 Instead of a meal plan why not become totally equipped to make better food choices for yourself

👉 Instead of trying to ‘eat clean’ why not find an 80/20 balance and count calories 

👉 Instead of trying to exercise more - sleep more

👉Instead of trying to use detox teas, shakes and ACV - drink more water 

❌And stop being so impatient and inconsistent.

How are your New Years Resolutions coming along? 

Are you struggling? 

Is it sustainable? 

My clients are thriving 🙌

Why? 
 - Because I make it easy for them ✅

But how?
- Well instead of giving them 7 million tasks in week one. I have a much slower, more sustainable approach! I use healthy habits to help them adjust to a long term lifestyle change. 

❌It’s not pretty. 
❌It’s not fancy. 
❌It doesn’t sell well.

✅ But it works. You see if you commit to the long term, you can do it slower. If you’re only commiting to 6 weeks - you have to change immediately. But we all know nothing changes that quick. Nothing sustainable anyway. It takes time. It takes effort. But we’re here for the long term so who’s rushing? 🤷‍♀️

✅ My ethos is you only have ONE BODY - ONE PLACE to call home! You need to look after it. You need to mind and care for it. 

- If your house was falling apart around you or your car was dangerous to drive you’d pay any amount to fix it. How come when it comes to our body - OUR HOME - an investment is too expensive or not worth it? 🤔

Yay or Nay? 🧐

I put up a poll on my Instagram before Christmas to see who would be training over the holidays and 90% of you said you would. 

Sometimes, we have really high expectations of ourselves that when we don’t meet those expectations - we become disappointed 😔 While having high expectations is not necessarily a bad thing, being realistic is important 🙏

Going on holidays this Christmas I recognised that training was not going to be a priority to me. I said I’d train 2-3 times a week because I love it - not because I HAD to. 

There is NO NECESSITY for you to train during holidays. If you want to - do it! If you don’t - don’t! One thing I will say is 1. Do it for the right reasons - maybe that’s to get back into a routine, or for your mental health - but NOT to ‘burn off calories’

2. Whatever decision you make - own it! Don’t go winging and complaining after 3 weeks off that ‘you wish you did a bit’ or ‘how sore you are’. Get over it and get on with it.

Here’s my TOP TIP - Build your meals around the protein source🙃

My first thought at any meal is what is the protein? And then I build my meal from there! 

People will blame time for their poor food choices but I can assure you, you don’t have to be super organised to make better choices! (The last 2 days I’ve been eating Turkey burgers, microwave rice and microwave cauliflower rice)

When I go shopping I like to have a rough guide done of what I’ll eat during the week so all the options are in my house - that way I’ve no excuses to eat out or make poor food choices! And if you do eat out, there’s NUMEROUS options to align with your goals!

18,2023-01-05 19:36:13+11:00,"I think my CrossFit journey has been a little like your weight loss journey and here’s why 👂

I was asked to do my first CrossFit competition late 2018.

I first started to dabble in Crossfit in 2019. 

I would just do random workouts with random exercises and to be fair - it was enough to win competitions at a scaled level.

In 2020, I joined a CrossFit gym and this is where I say my journey began.

I can honestly say the most progress I’ve made was in the last 6 months of 2022. 

Let me tell you why? 

I started a programme that was tailored to my goals. A structured progressive overload programme that was in accordance with my goals.

Ok let me relate this back to your weight loss journey. 

My first year of CrossFit I was essentially pissing in the wind. Random workouts with no structure. But I still made progress. Does that relate to the start of your journey? You were doing it alone but you still lost weight because you made some small changes?

The next year and a half - I programme hopped - I think I did 3 different programmes in the space of 1.5 years with none of them aligning with my goals. Although the process of programme hopping in itself is the problem - not sticking with something long enough to see the results 🫣

The last 6 months I feel like Goldilocks, I’ve got it just right. This programme is geared towards my goals. It allows for progression and I’ve reaped the rewards!

You see this could be you. 

Maybe you’ve had the same journey as me?

Maybe you’ve tried it alone?

You’ve tried many diets or coaches or programmes that didn’t work?

But take it from me - when you find the right one - you’ll never look back 💪",62,8,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/323367005_489444910036524_8236448764833263749_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=WvG7Khvre_QAX_O9lIr&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfB8BFkuVzSchq49jdyM9DLdZ6t_3se9dIvHrR42Mya8-A&oe=6405F478,https://www.instagram.com/p/CnBul-6IP15/,17942300240367983,"[{'timestamp': '2023-01-05T09:19:22+0000', 'text': '🤩\U0001faf6🏼', 'username': 'niamhhod', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2023-01-05T09:27:42+0000', 'text': '@niamhhod 😘', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '17986574737743079'}]}, 'id': '17854008641859784'}, {'timestamp': '2023-01-05T08:50:39+0000', 'text': 'What a beast 👏', 'username': 'tori_tucka', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2023-01-05T09:02:36+0000', 'text': '@tori_tucka always the best cheerleader ❤️', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '17970413375011827'}]}, 'id': '17961555584230941'}, {'timestamp': '2023-01-05T08:49:14+0000', 'text': 'Wow.....your body is unreal fit...you look amazing...🥰', 'username': 'karentrayers', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2023-01-05T09:03:15+0000', 'text': '@karentrayers ah thank you Karen!

They feel they have no time to go to the gym because they are too busy. Or they don’t have time to be making seperate dinners for their family.

Thankfully a lot of my clients train from home 3 times a week with minimal equipment. And I NEVER ask them to make seperate dinners.

You see the thing is - you don't actually need hours in the gym to achieve your goals - especially if you're crazy busy. I also encourage women to make better, more simple choices if they are too busy to cook. And instead of scrolling on Social media - I set step targets for them (even if they scroll while they walk). 

You see - it's pretty simple. Try this out and let me know how it goes.

It's so frustrating because you're trying to be a good friend, mother, daughter, sister, colleague, or employee. But what's left for you? Or maybe there is time? 

I've found that most people usually can find time. Maybe instead of an hour of Netflix we could swap it for a workout? Maybe instead of scrolling we could be walking? Or instead of picking up a takeaway on the way home from work, we could pick up a ready meal in a supermarket? The problem lies in trying to do too much.

Women lack education and understanding around nutrition which causes serial yo yo dieting. 

To fix this problem, you need more nutrition education on how you can eat the foods you love and still get the results you deserve. 

Here's how it works: 

As a qualified nutritionist, I educate females on how to make good food choices to achieve their goals. I don't focus on short term quick fixes but long term sustainable results. I genuinely believe if you hand someone a diet plan you will only help them so far,  but if you educate them on a balanced lifestyle - this is invaluable.

November was hectic (my Dad's Anniversary and Birthday, moving house, sorting visas and multiple competitions). It was a bit of a whirlwind.

This is my first time home in 3 years, It's definitely different to Christmas in Austrailia, I’ll have a lot more clothes on this Christmas Day 😅 

This year - I’ll be focusing on my little black dress rather than a bikini. Some of my clients are already sending me pictures of their Christmas clothes and are excited to be buying them in sizes smaller or tighter fit 🙏🙌

Let me tell you as with EVERYTHING in life - there are pros and cons to everything. 

What I am doing now is LITERALLY my dream job ❤️🔥 And I wouldn’t change it for the world. But nothing good in life comes without sacrifice.

While most people take a trip home and enjoy a month off. I will be working. (I’ll take the holidays off) But my job doesn’t stop ✋ 

Goals require sacrifice. Achievements require sacrifice. Nothing is handed to anyone.

The same goes for fat loss or weight loss.

Effort determines the result! 

So next time you think - someone is ‘so lucky’ - think of what they did to achieve that. No matter what area of life - jobs, fitness, weight loss, relationships - I can assure you - that person has sacrificed something somewhere 🔥",224,10,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319944493_474224254635618_4954826788373541070_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=nLbhdyEa6fsAX9L8qqm&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfC2qQw34rrmI4t-ajjuI97vs6DkinFpid_psFFHA7iPLw&oe=640508B5,https://www.instagram.com/p/CmLSy_FI6ES/,17937622163398502,"[{'timestamp': '2022-12-16T07:27:59+0000', 'text': 'Great to have you home🙏❤️', 'username': 'fullbodyworkhouse', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2022-12-16T11:24:49+0000', 'text': '@fullbodyworkhouse see you next week ❤️', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '17961959702169799'}]}, 'id': '17977709728878215'}, {'timestamp': '2022-12-15T12:22:54+0000', 'text': 'Welcome back❤️', 'username': 'kjheery', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2022-12-15T12:42:14+0000', 'text': '@kjheery thank you ❤️', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '17934761906532880'}]}, 'id': '17969097652996055'}, {'timestamp': '2022-12-15T06:22:37+0000', 'text': ""Well said!

Fitness is not just fitness.

Eating healthy food is not just nourishing your body.

The Strong and Sassy programme is continuing to CHANGES LIVES ❤️🔥

You may THINK you just need a gym.

You may THINK you just need a diet plan.

What you really need is support and accountability 🙏

Emily started this programme with her confidence levels at an all time low. She wasn’t happy in how she looked or felt 🥹

Now 9 months later -
✅ She has completed true grit
✅ Lost 13.5kg
✅ Become the STRONGEST version of herself
✅ Gained confidence

20,2022-12-07 05:51:18+11:00,"Christmas is well and truely on its way. While this is an exciting time and a time where people are socialising more and enjoying themselves more. I’ve actually found it can be a hugely anxious time for people too.🥹

I’ve witnessed women who are hugely self conscious and unhappy in their body struggle to pick an outfit for a Christmas dinner.

I’ve seen women change about 10 times before throwing on the baggiest option they can find.

Up until this year - that was Teresa. Teresa hid behind bigger clothes in an effort to feel better.

I remember once upon a time - myself - holding onto clothes ‘that would fit again’.

Ladies this has to stop 🛑 

I am telling you now - it’s not about weight loss. It’s not about a clothes size. It’s not about number on the weighing scales.

It’s about feeling good internally.

It’s about having a balanced lifestyle. Nourishing your body but never feeling guilty about food. It’s about exercising because you enjoy it. Not using it as punishment. ❌

Until you can find that internal happiness - it doesn’t matter what diet you’re doing, what calories you’re eating, what exercise you’re doing - you won’t be comfortable and confident.

But the good news is - I have the solution🙋‍♀️

My Strong and Sassy programme was designed specifically to help women become the healthiest, happiest and most confident versions of themselves.

If you want to become like Sarah - who is now ROCKING tight, figure hugging clothes. Or Jennifer who is wearing bikinis and crop tops.

22,2022-12-02 06:09:04+11:00,"Want to get fitter, stronger, leaner? 🧐

1. Nutrition is the most important element to these goals - are you eating enough protein? Are you eating healthy but not tracking calories? Are you blowing calories mindlessly at weekends? All questions that you should ask yourself when having a goal!

2. Random classes = random results. Follow a progressive overload programme and watch the results flow in

3. One of the most underrated performance tools - sleep! Stop neglecting it - start treating it as important as nutrition and even MORE important than exercise!

To say I’m proud would be an understatement here and be prepared for a long post 😂

Going into my first individual event my expectations were to keep within the Top 6. So winning this event was truely special 🥰

With 3 event wins, I can honestly say my proudest moment was 3rd in the last event 😂 I went to one of the darkest places I’ve ever been in my training and I would not have got through it without my ultimate cheer squad @lillie704 @lift__with__laura @misssophieelizabeth @col_ryaner @renners9 @o_boyce 

I feel so thankful and grateful to be ABLE to push my body to these limits and how fun is it doing it with the best crew. Even more special was podiuming with @brian_fannon 🙌🙏

As always with every competition, there’s things to learn and FUCK these girls are STRONG 💪 So there’s still lots to be done 🙏

Thank you to @battleofbenton for an incredible event. Ran impeccably from start to finish. 

And the biggest thank you to @jaydenazza @crossfitbotany who had me in this condition going into this competition. The future is looking bright 💃

That’s it for the competitions for 2022 (never again will I do 3 in a row 😂).

Does that mean you shouldn’t try? Absolutely not!

Hear me out 👂

Travel is not easy. You’ve to travel to an airport. Have a passport to board. Pack all your clothes and items you’ll need. Board a plane. Travel hours depending on where you go. Set up in another part of the world. Find new places and set yourself up.

But you don’t NOT do it. It has a few requirements and pre requisites but if you want it - you’ll tick all of the boxes. 

Age is like the distance to the destination. Some flights take longer, some countries are further away. But that DOES not mean we can’t make it to our destination! 

What makes the journey easier? 
- Nutrition Habits that create long term sustainable change - rather than quick fix 6 week challenges (comparing a first class Quantas flight to a RyanAir flight here incase you missed it)
- Resistance based training that supports healthy hormones, bone mass density and reducing muscle mass decrease (airbus a380 versus a Boeing 737)
- Accountability and support. (We all know how good an attentive cabin crew is 🙏)
- Yes there are more considerations to consider here but that’s the beauty of having a coach. You can discuss these topics and work on them.

- I’ve helped 100s of women achieve their goals all ages. All shapes and sizes. Nothing is a ‘too difficult’.

And that’s ok! 

Firstly, we need to understand some biology here. Women have approximately DOUBLE the amount of essential body fat that a man has. What does essential mean? We need it. It’s necessary for our overall health. 

Secondly, understand when a female has visible abs - they are usually on the threshold of that healthy/unhealthy body fat percentage. 
If they are super active or athletes and consuming adequate calories and have a higher lean muscle mass - often they’re body fat percentage is healthy for their level. On the other hand, someone who has <18% Body Fat from extreme dieting with low lean muscle mass is mostly considered an unhealthy body composition.

Lastly and MOST importantly, the main reason why most women will never have visible abs is because they are simply not willing to make the sacrifices to achieve them. And that’s PERFECTLY alright. In a lot of instances women would have to give up social occassions, wine & chocolate. And have to engage in a lot more activity than their time schedules allow! 🙏

So if you have that as a goal - have a little think about the above points.

Young Amanda, started learning more and with more knowledge came more power 😍 Knowledge helped improve my nutrition choices! All of a sudden, with better nutrition choices, I’m feeling more energetic, I’m not constantly sick, I’m starting to gain a little muscle and I’m sleeping better 🥰

Fast forward - 7 years later - and you have the Coach Mc Loone you see today. But that person did not always exsist. You see through knowledge I gained power. I now KNOW how to nourish my body, how to become strong, how to feel energised.

Let me give you an example. Comparing my 24 hours with a 40 year old working mother of 4 is just INCOMPARABLE!!!!

It’s not that the 40 year old mother of 4 doesn’t WANT to look after her health and fitness (I literally have women with these credentials doing the Strong and Sassy Programme).

I have the luxury of working from home. Because of time differences with clients - the bulk of my work is done mornings and evenings so my free time is during the day. I’ve no kids. No mortgages. Life is EASIER for me! So my 24 hours are very different to my clients.

Like Mandi who is a mother of 5 and runs her own business. She prioritises her workouts when her kids are gone to school💃

Or Elaine who is a doctor - has to get her workouts done on her lunch break 💪

Jacqui is doing tennis as her exercise - she gets to socialise and exercise 🎾 

Gillian who doesn’t want to make different meals for her family - controls portions and adds extra veg.

Lucy who is commuting 2hours a day - has her meals and snacks prepared!

I could lie to you and tell you the Strong and Sassy programme is the best strength programme around. But truth is all programmes can work - if you can be consistent with them. How can we stay consistent with them?

I spoke with a friend yesterday who used to do classes in the gym and has recently started an online programme. She said ‘it actually keeps her more accountable- because if she misses a day of the programme - it messes up the rest of her programme. Plus she has someone checking in with her each week’. The accountability of her programme is MAKING her be more consistent. With classes, if she missed a day - no one checked in to see why? It didn’t have an impact on the rest of her programme, she just picked up where she left off?

Online programmes allow you to have more flexibility and freedom. But also, regular check ins mean you’ve always someone holding you accountable.

As a woman, one of the greatest signs of health is a regular, monthly cycle. 🙏❤️

I know it’s a nuisance. I know it can be painful. I know it can cause us to be a bottomless pit 🐷 (p.s out BMR actually increases the week before our period - so we actually NEED extra calories 😍)

But if overall health is your goal - a regular monthly cycle is the pinnacle of health. If for some reason, you’re not getting a monthly cycle (unknown reason) - please reach out to your doctor.

I’m particularly happy to see mine this time around. Why?

Because mine arrived 7 days LATE! We knew we weren’t expecting any baby Boyce’s- I knew EXACTLY why my period was late and I actually anticipated it.

I’m SUPER in tune with my body. I know what’ll put it out of whack. I know that travel causes disruptions to my cycle. I know that alcohol has an effect on it and I know the impact stress has on my body too.

As I’ve harped on about the last few weeks have been super stressful for me. You could join the dots with all spots on my neck and chest and I knew something had to give.

Do NOT underestimate the affect of stress on your body. It affects our health in more ways than people could even imagine. Accumulation of stress can lead to much greater health risks than a delayed period - so do something about it today ❤️🙏

If you don’t fail. Are you even really trying? 🤔

When it comes to strength training and a structured programme we work a lot of percentages. Some days the weights feel great - and like you could actually add a little extra. Other days 10kg feels like 100 😬🥹

When you’ve been strength training for as long as I have pbs don’t come that often either. (If you’re in the shiny new year of strength training and still hitting pbs all the time - enjoy this 😂)

Failing is part of life - if we fail - at least we know we tried. The thing about failing is though. At SOME point - you will succeed. If you KEEP CONSISTENT and follow a plan - you WILL achieve that number or target or goal.

The same goes for a diet! With nutrition, even if you’ve failed 100 times - you’ve can STILL achieve that goal.

Lecturer 

Hazel is super active. She actually just completed an Iron Man at the weekend 💪

There were 3 main reason Hazel wanted to join the Strong and Sassy programme

1. Get a home based strength programme to accomodate her training goals

2. Work on her nutrition - she’s always been active but knows she needs to work more on her nutrition (not just for weight loss but also to match her activity)

3. As she’s getting older, she wants to support her overall health. Prepare her body as best as possible for the next stage of her life 🙏

She’s already reaping the rewards as she completed her Ironman at the weekend.

I’m so proud of this lady and the commitment she makes even with a super busy schedule 🔥

18,2022-11-08 05:47:44+11:00,"Moving house has been listed as one of the most stressful events in your life. Up there with loss of a loved one and divorce.

Unfortunately, I’ve experienced 2 of the 3.

I can honestly say the strain it puts on your physical and mental health is difficult but the most notable stress was the one I experienced with Owen. 

I was moody, complaining constantly and actually quite aggressive. But thankfully, it was short term and I’m back to my normal happy, bubbly self 🙏

This reminded me of a client (a couple of them actually) who was constantly agitated and barking at her partner. The poor fella couldn’t do anything right. 

Why? Why was she constantly cranky to her partner? We soon realised two things that were causing these mood disturbances.
1. She was on crazy low calories - constantly hungry and lacking in energy (anyone who has been HANGRY understands 🙈)
2. She was desperately unhappy in how she viewed herself. This unhappiness in herself projected into her moody outbursts and they were becoming too frequent.

She was GENUINELY worried these feelings were going to have a long term impact on her relationship.

So what did we do?
1. The first one was easy - increasing calories to a normal level while still allowing her to achieve her goals. Her energy levels sky rocketed and her mood instantly improved.
2. Working on self confidence and self esteem was a little trickier. We started to focus on her health from an internal perspective and not just what her body looked like on the outside. We started to do resistance based training and she started to appreciate what her body could do instead of just ‘burning calories’.

Within weeks, her mood improved dramatically, and the cranky outbursts declined steadily. She is now happier in herself than ever before and her partner is also reaping the rewards!!!

Sound familiar? You’re not alone! But you CAN change - with the right guidance and support anything is possible 🙏",97,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/314492045_688037352667917_8287893107491535563_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=iAqTGv0G3cQAX98ZjFh&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfBrQdBn568GXymDYDuNPJ-Q4qFriramHPML131_noILnQ&oe=6405BE71,https://www.instagram.com/p/Ckq5rKABIIZ/,18188865568225001,,,,
19,2022-11-07 06:53:46+11:00,"Let’s talk mindset 🤯

I stand out of my comfort zone pretty regularly. But twice this year, I stood out of my comfort zone big time.

First, was a novice Weightlifitng competition. Second, a half marathon. 

Why take on these challenges?

Because guess what - it’s not your body that’s saying no. It’s your mind. Your body is capable of a lot more than you think.

It’s not easy going to competitions knowing you won’t win. It’s not easy being 20kg behind other peoples lifts. It’s not easy running 21km. 

But it helps you learn. It builds character. Everytime you step outside that comfort zone you build a little more resilience, a little more confidence. 

I spoke to a client last week and she talked about how increasing calories was mentally challenging. I get it I do, comfort zones are easier.

It’s easy to continue training and exercising while ignoring the biggest problem that’s not allowing you achieve your goals (nutrition 🙈). It’s easy to do 6 week challenges every quarter - lose weight and regain it because you couldn’t sustain it.

What’s not easy? 
Committing to a 6 month programme to improve your habits and make LONG TERM sustainable change.

Quite often people think you need to do more to achieve your goals. And in a lot of cases that is true - more exercise, more water, better nutrition. But for some actually less is more. 
.
.
Everyone has their problem areas. 

👉Some people nail nutrition and exercise and can’t understand why they can’t lose weight - while their bodies are in chronic sleep deprivation 🤦‍♀️ 

👉Others weigh in the week before their period and can’t understand why their weight fluctuates. 

👉Others would rather take a supplement than eat real food 🙈

👉 No ice baths will not mask the fact that you’ve been boozing Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

.
These are some of the elements to think about when it comes to your goals - in no particular order 👊

Nutrition and exercise are not the only 2 elements you can control. If you have those nailed why not look at other areas? 🤔

✅ Works in a different country to the one she lives in

✅ Kids with autism

Have you been on the fence for awhile and still not sure if online coaching is for you?

Do any of these scenarios sound familiar?🤔🤔🤔

👉 You’ve been eating really healthy Monday to Friday - weekend comes and all hell breaks loose. Chocolate, wine, crisps, chips - everything! 🥹

👉 You’ve LITERALLY tried EVERYTHING. Every diet. Every exercise known to man and NOTHING WORKS 😭

👉 You’re a working mother and gym class times don’t suit your busy schedule. 🤯

👉 You’re hiding in clothes that are oversized and baggy but you secretly keep the smaller clothes that used to fit you - just incase! 😢

👉 You avoid photos being taken of you or hide behind people because you’re embarrassed or ashamed 😔

👉 You get ready to go out for dinner with your partner and try on everything in your wardrobe - and settle for the jeans and top because nothing feels comfortable 😦

👉 You’re exercising relentlessly but never achieving the physique you’re aspiring to. 

I know there are people out there who not only relate to one of the above but maybe even multiple 😭 And it’s not for the lack of trying. You feel like you’ve been trying your whole life and nothing ever works.

What if I told you - I have the solution! To every single one of the above scenarios? 😱

Because I do! 

And I know this because I have helped women overcome every single one of the above situations. 

🔥 Look at Simone (mother) - who completed ALL of her training from home. 

🔥 Check out Ciara (nurse) - who is finally seeing progress in the gym with her own personalised programme.

🔥 Teresa (mother) - who is the fittest she’s been in years and feeling incredible in a dress

🔥 Elaine (doctor) - who ran 10km for the first time.

🔥 Jennifer (nurse) - who has finally found the right nutrition balance and no longer worries about scale weight.

How amazing is it to be a strong woman 💪22.5kg Dumbbell feels light to me. When I started in the gym, I wasn’t lifting above a 5kg over my head 🤌

I’ll be honest, I learned ALOT. Although we finished in an INCREDIBLE fourth position with all top 5 finishes and I’m BEYOND proud of our efforts - My focus will be on my weaknesses 🏋️‍♀️ 

I’ve been strength training for 10 years and football fitness means I have a decent cardio background. But I’ve only been doing CrossFit for 2.5 years so the skills side of it is still a major weakness. My gymnastics capacity and barbell cycling is NOT where I want it to be. That’s ok - I have high expectations and I’m willing to put in the work ⛏

From my experience, most women are control freaks (I’m one too 🙊😂). We think we need to know everything. We are strong independent women afraid to rely on others for help ☹️

We think we should ‘know what to do’ in all areas of life. But from my experience - those who delegate work to other people in different areas of their life - often have the most success.

Why?
Because it’s one less thing for YOU to do.

Having a coach to help you with your health and fitness is actually a shortcut! 

Why? Because the expertise, accountability and the right plan allows you to HAVE MORE TIME! 

Not only that - you’re not WASTING your time trailing methods that may or may not work for you!

I’ll give you an example. 
Were you that slim 20 year old that could eat whatever she wanted without ever gaining weight. So you ate takeaways and never exercised? Your 40 year old self may not feel the same way. 

I try to educate to my clients that every action you take has a consequence. You may not be able to see it in the short term, but long term your body is thanking you 🙏❤️

Another example - last week I was talking to my clients about menopause. Now majority of my clients are a long way away from menopause - so why talk to them about it?
Every action they choose between now and then can have an impact on their symptoms. For example - if you start resistance training in your 20s - your menopausal body will thank you 🙏 

Every action has a consequence. If you constantly rely on short term gratification- there will be long term consequences.

Not going to lie - this is a trigger for me. I absolutely HATE the term. I hate it a little bit less than ‘I don’t want to get bulky’ 😂

Anyway here’s what you need to do to ‘tone up’

1. Understand what it is you’re saying 😂 you want to change your body composition which is reducing your body fat mass and increasing your lean muscle mass. 

2. Lift weights - a body building style progressive overload programme is best for this if aesthetic goals are what you’re looking for

3. Control your food intake - easiest achieved by a calorie deficit

4. Be consistent - it doesn’t happen overnight so you may aswell enjoy the process.

You’re a daughter, an employee, a friend, maybe a sister or a mother…

The ONLY way you can become the best version of you is by attending to your own oxygen mask first.

Running yourself into the ground is the exact opposite–and it’s taking you further away from being that person. 

Self-Care is a selfless act. 

When YOU are at your best, in shape, full of energy and confidence… you can serve everyone around you at the highest level and feel AMAZING doing it. 

People around you will recognize your work and follow your example. 

When you aren’t at your best, you simply can’t do that. It’s impossible.

Just ask my client Teresa who has found her ‘me time’ and continues to find it every week. She trains from home in the morning and has just completed a half marathon and done breathwork for the first time in her life.

Or my clients who do shift work. And even though it’s difficult to find a good routine - they manage to smash it every week. 

Or what about Elaine who moved continent, works abroad, has 2 kids with special needs AND IS A DOCTOR!

I had two thoughts -
1. My picky eating habits have come a long way in the last 10 years 
2. I’m so grateful to eat food with 0 guilt, no working off calories or depriving myself of the foods I love.

When I wanted to become a nutritionist - my family were astounded - ‘but you don’t eat anything’ . I had a diet full of beige foods and very little protein. They were right 😂 but I loved science and I wanted to understand how nutrition affects the body.

The pickiness was something that weaned it’s way out as I aged and was more open to food suggestions.

The guilt and binging was a whole different kettle of fish…

For anyone who knows my background, you’ll know I played Gaelic football almost my whole life. 

I know 29 is NOT old. I’m well aware of this. But when you’re competing against people who started in their early teens it’s pretty late to the party.

I have clients who never consistently exercised until 40.

I have clients who only started becoming knowledgeable on nutrition at 50.

You see the thing is. 

We tell ourselves a story in our head.

I’ll wait until Monday.

I’ll wait until next month.

I’ll start in the New Year.

It’s easy to say we’ll start - when we’re ready. Or until we have time to commit to it.

You see the thing is. We’re actually not guaranteed time. My Dad died at 55. Him dying at such a young age, made me truely value time! 

If you want something, you have to start now. Not when you’re ready or when the perfect circumstances arise. You have to be willing to start now.

I’ve 3 competitions coming up over the next few months and I am BUZZING! You see I decided I want to become the healthiest, fittest and strongest version of myself and that’s the commitment I’ve made to myself.

There’s 11 weeks left in 2022. 11 weeks could get you started to becoming the healthiest and happiest version of yourself. If you’re sick of waiting for the right time and want to make a change NOW.

8,2022-10-18 05:40:11+11:00,"Let’s talk sacrifice.

There’s no doubt about it. In order to achieve our goals - we need to make sacrifice.

I do believe however, our sacrifices have to be less extreme and a lot more sustainable.
For example: People who embark on diets of no sugar, no carbs and no alcohol would be much better off just reducing the frequency and quantity of these foods or drinks in their diet.

My client Jennifer has dramatically reduced her alcohol consumption. She’s not taking extreme measures or going off it forever but she doesn’t prioritise it anymore.

Personally, I have a lot of competitions coming up over the next few weeks so I will definitely have to make sacrifices. Socialising takes a back seat during these busy periods.

Sacrifice is inevitable. But what you sacrifice is up to you. Stop with the extremes of 0 or 100%.

10,2022-10-14 20:24:55+11:00,"Successful testing week ✅

The last 4 months I have not been focusing on strength so I wasn’t expecting any significant strength gains. And that’s ok, my training is periodised and I have other fish to fry so goals change.

The reason this testing week was so successful was I’ve been hugely focusing on technique and being pain free 🙌

For me personally, this is key. It’s all well and good clocking up big numbers but if your technique sucks - it will catch up on you in one way or another.

Personal wins for me this week:

✅ My beautiful snatch 🥰 Because I am FINALLY squat snatching my numbers actually went up to but honestly if my numbers remained the same and I improved my technique I would have been happy.

✅ I’m also finally squat cleaning - my body is still in a little bit of shock (if you’re a power clean person you’ll know what I mean) but slowly but surely I’m getting more confident and comfortable under that bar.

✅ PB Split Jerk - again due to technique improvement 🙌

✅ Shoulder Pressing - pain free. For a LONG time I’ve had pain while shoulder pressing and it made me shy away from the movement. How good is it to move a weight without pain 🙏

✅ Gymnastics - my obvious downfall when it comes to CF but with INCREDIBLE guidance and coaching - this weakness is starting to become much better. And again, doing it with a structured programme has allowed for pain free movement.

I’ve realised with the right programme and mentoring anything is possible. 

So please no matter what your goals are there is a roadmap for you to achieve them. You may not have found it in the past, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find it in the future. Remember your goals. Remember not everyone’s are the same and what works for someone else - may not work for you. But don’t give up trying 🙏",179,47,VIDEO,REELS,,https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjsGI-3hx5u/,17931793925359543,"[{'timestamp': '2022-10-16T15:42:56+0000', 'text': 'Well done you girlie 👏👏', 'username': 'lilzaiceva', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '17963546917986018'}, {'timestamp': '2022-10-14T22:40:42+0000', 'text': 'You are an inspiration!!!

You see I get this all the time.

This story reminds me of most peoples health and fitness journey. Most people know what to do - but don’t apply it!

Maybe if I had someone keeping me accountable - Amanda to achieve x, you need to do extra shooting drills 3 times a week. Honestly, I think I would have done it! Or if I had some encouragement to try and achieve it!

Maybe all you’re missing is that encouragement to go and achieve your health and fitness goals. Maybe you need someone to be accountable to you - to do the work for you.  You need to eat x,y & z and train Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

There’s no criteria to becoming a Strong and Sassy female. There’s no age limit or fitness level required.

What I do expect - 
🔥 Commitment
🔥 To show up 
🔥 Enjoy the person you are about to become

✨Aoibheann has been with me for quite awhile. She originally started during lockdown and had fantastic physical results. She came back to me recently to strike a balance between socialising and commiting to her health and fitness. Having turned 30 at the weekend - she is feeling the best

✨ Simone is a working momma who initially signed up for 6 months but ended up staying a year 😍 She honestly had every excuse to NOT prioritise herself but she didn’t let the excuses get in her way. 8kg later - she’s the healthiest fittest version of herself and everyone is noticing.

✨ Teresa had been consistently training before coming to me. Once she had that nailed she wanted to dial in on her nutrition. While she worked immensely hard on her nutrition we also educated her on the importance of sleep and stress management and her coffee intake DRAMATICALLY decreased.

✨ Laura (teacher) wanted to find a balance and get back into a good exercise regime. Not only did she lose weight on the scales but her confidence grew exponentially.

These are just the physical results you can achieve from doing my Strong and Sassy programme. In my opinion, the mental changes are what makes this different!",18,1,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311168611_189309896906456_2668601273495693915_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=N8WCnLPK0P0AX-F6dnZ&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfAJ8rD3z2-jChXA_pSR70vyXKt3LeVXkiXj-XvUjdC9pA&oe=6405618E,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cjn-Kvuhnx0/,18159725467251161,,,,

Teresa had sent me this photo -beaming from ear to ear with pride.

She had just completed a half marathon in 2hours 18mins.

Let me tell you a little bit about Teresa’s journey.

Firstly, and probably most importantly - she thought Online Coaching was a scam 😅

She didn’t know what she had signed up to with her initial call with Brian but she went for it anyway 🙈

After realising it wasn’t a scam and after a great consultation call - she actually realised this was the perfect programme for her lifestyle (she’s a working mother).

She initially signed up to 12 weeks and had an initial goal of running a 10km.

6 months later - she has signed up for ANOTHER 3 Months AND completed a half marathon.

This isn’t a fluke.

This is what you get when you surround yourself with a great like minded community and a coach who supports and educated you.

Teresa now describes the programme as ‘her time’ and the best investment she’s ever made in herself.

I put up a question box asking ‘why people like following me’ and a lovely lady responded ‘Confident, go getter’.

Wow 🤩 

That is EXACTLY how I’d like to be described.

This absolutely warmed my heart because honestly that has not always been the case.

When I was younger I conformed to societal norms. I REALLY REALLY wanted to be liked. I craved attention so badly. To the naked eye - I probably appeared Uber confident. I was loud and always trying to be the centre of attention. 

I defined my worth on how many friends I had. How much money I had. Having the latest brands and caking my face in make up. I genuinely believed ‘that is what confident is’.

But I couldn’t have been more wrong.

I was young and immature. 

I don’t regret it. Because I truely believe these things mould you into the person you become.

I now realise confidence is not walking into a room expecting and hoping people will like me. Confidence is walking into a room and not caring if they do!

Confidence is wearing a bikini or dress at any time of the year and not worrying about what anyone else thinks.

Confidence is belief in yourself and your own abilities but never belittling someone else for your gain.

Confidence is NOT something you’re born with. Confidence is something you have to work on -  day in day out. It’s something you have to talk to yourself about. Something that needs reassurance from time to time. 

But confidence will make you happier than any scale weight, any dress size or any weight lifted.

And guess what - it’s my speciality.

1. My lean muscle mass means that my BMR is higher. More muscle = more calories

2. Resistance training - lifting weights supports an increased BMR. Lifting weights does not need to be in a gym - remember half my clients train from home and achieve incredible results.

3. I’ve been training at a high level - both cardio and strength for 10+ years - time frame matters

4. The type of food I consume - NOT JUST CALORIES - I support a balanced lifestyle but most of my nutrition comes from wholefoods

5. I sleep 7.5-8 hours a night

6. Alcohol is not a priority. It doesn’t mean I don’t drink. It means I’d rather train on a Saturday morning than drink on a Friday night.

See what I’m getting at…

So why would we all do the same thing 🤔

‘But my friend Mary did paleo and she lost a stone in a month’

Yes Sarah - but you’re 5 years older than her, have 2 kids more than her and she has been training for 10 years’

Truth is - even if Sarah didn’t have 2 kids, was 5 years younger and trained for 10 years she may STILL never get the same results as Mary 🤷‍♀️

Because EVERYONE is different 😣

I’m sorry if that’s not the answer you wanted to hear but it’s the truth 🙈

So next time - you try to compare - please don’t!

Every single person I deal with has different goals and how I coach them varies from person to person.

Sometimes I have clients who come to me thinking they need to dial in on their nutrition - when they actually need to stress less and sleep more 💤

Other ladies think they need to be training 7 days a week when they actually need to do less and walk more.

Don’t settle for cookie cutter.

She has been training on and off for years. Her main goal was to get into a good routine and be accountable. She was looking for a long term sustainable change - without restriction. 

Before we started working together Helen did programmes and trained - but as soon as she had a bad week or didn’t see the scales moving - she gave up. She found herself unhappy in her clothes and she was sick of stopping and starting. 

She hesitated in starting because of pride ‘She thought she could and should do it alone’. And if she's honest, she thought ‘I know what to do’. But she realised she needed direction, accountability and a community - which drove her to take action.
(P.s Helen is a trainer and has a background in Health promotion - but even coaches need coaches)

For those of you who don’t already know, I lost my Dad to pancreatic cancer.

I can tell you right now - it was without a doubt one of the hardest times in my entire life. 

I can tell you another thing - one of the biggest things that got me through it was training! 

I would hope it’s obvious that I was not motivated to eat healthy when my Dad was terminally ill. The easy option was to eat takeaways - but instead I brought my tupperware to Tullamore hospital! I also think it’s obvious that when he eventually passed away - I wasn’t waking up BUZZING to get to the gym.

But I still went…

I still showed up.

Even when my Dad was dying. Even when he died. I SHOWED up! I didn’t eat rubbish or crap or convenience! 

Why? 
- Because I said I would. I am committed to myself - not only when it’s easy and I’m positive and I’m motivated. I’m committed to my health even more on the tough days - on the days I barely feel like getting out of bed. 

And I will continue to commit to myself. I will continue to show up for myself.

5am alarm clock…

Whether I’m doing coaching calls or the odd outdoor training session, my 5am alarm is a constant. I’m without a doubt a morning lark and get all my most productive work done in the morning! 

I’ll usually get a little walk in mid morning or afternoon. My job is actually quite sedentary but my 10,000 steps is a non negotiable.

I train either early afternoon or 4pm. I train  days - sometimes twice a day. 
(P.s for anyone thinking you need to do this it is ABSOLUTELY UNNECESSARY unless you have a sporting goal - which I do)

My bedtime is 8.30pm sharp and I honestly think I have the sleep requirements of a newborn baby 😂

I went to a life coach a few years ago and he asked me my dream job. I couldn’t give him an answer but I could say this -
✅ choose my working hours 
✅ have my own business
✅ help as many people as possible in the world
✅ be an educator 

Turns out I’ve pretty much nailed that job down 😂 

This lifestyle works for me. I’m so happy that I have this career and it allows me to train the way I would like to also. But for majority of people - training that much is unnecessary and honestly, does not fit into many people’s time schedule.

Be smarter and wiser with your time. So find what works for you and your lifestyle. And whatever it is - make sure it’s sustainable 💪👊

I’m super tired after the four hour drive home today.

Easy to let excuses slip in for not having my food prepared or not train tomorrow.

But see the thing is - my health and fitness is a priority to me. I could have EASILY opted for Uber Eats but having good nutritious food in my fridge is essential for me. 

I’ll be in bed super early so training doesn’t suffer also. Again, training is a priority. I don’t allow excuses especially not choices I’ve made myself 👊

23,2022-09-30 05:10:12+10:00,"It’s hard to believe that once upon a time I couldn’t do chin ups.

Because guess what - that’s the reality.

Once upon a time, I was EXACTLY where you are now. 

I couldn’t do an inverted row - let alone a chin up - and that was when I was training to be a Personal trainer 🫣

So what changed? 🤔
✨I started training consistently 
✨I designed a progressive overload programme (I’ve recently delegated my programming and coaching to others)
✨I started eating to fuel my body 
✨I showed up - even when I didn’t want to

And 10 years later - here we are. Not just doing chin ups but repping an extra 20kg to Bodyweight (which isn’t light btw 😅)

So why are you struggling so much to see progress?

Ok ask yourself -
☄️ Are you just doing random classes that achieve random results? Or are you doing a programme that works TOWARDS your goal? 
🤓P.s Doing chin ups once a week is NOT enough

☄️ Do you even have a goal?

☄️ Are you eating enough to fuel performance? 

☄️ Are you eating the correct types of foods?
🤓P.s contrary to what every other PT on the internet says this MOST CERTAINLY does matter

☄️ And finally and most importantly - Are you showing up?

You could have the best programme in the world, a million dollar nutrition coach and if you’re not applying it - you’re going NOWHERE!

⚡️HOW do I do a pull up?

So I’m about to let the cat out of the bag.

All of your goals can be achieved - if you just do ONE thing - BE CONSISTENT! 

I have been strength training for 10 years. That’s why I can do a pull up with ease. Not because of a programme or any gym. Because for 10 years I showed up. 

I have been taking my nutrition serious for a similar amount of time. So when someone comes to me looking for quick fix, or expecting miracles in a few months - that is my response.

You see consistency trumps EVERY diet or programme on the planet. 

So instead of trying to follow the next trend - why not show up - every week - no excuses, no complaints! 

If you find this difficult (like MANY people do) invest in some accountability, invest in someone who will HELP you when things get tough (because they will), invest in someone who pushes you on the days you don’t want to show up (because it will happen).

I wanted to give it more time…

I hoped and wished and prayed it would work for me…

But time and time again, I realised I was not achieving the results I wanted.

I’m a competitive athlete. Programme, coaching, nutrition, sleep, hydration and environment all have to be aligned for me to make progress. For the last few months, I was staying in an environment that I was comfortable in. I wasn’t seeing results and I wasn’t making progress. 

BUT it was all a choice. I was CHOOSING to stay the same. I was CHOOSING to not make progress – because I was CHOOSING to stay in the same environment. 

Have you ever been in that situation? 

💫 Maybe you’ve been with a coach for so long that you’re no longer getting the service you initially received. 

💫 Maybe you’ve been in a cycle of doing 6 week challenges with people – you don’t know how to do anything long term.

💫Maybe you’ve been with the same gym for years and you’re no longer pushed.

💫 Maybe you’ve been blaming your husband and kids for your lack of time? 

💫 Maybe you’ve used the excuse of - ‘I can’t or I’ll never be…’

5,2022-09-24 06:45:08+10:00,"Yesterday, I mentioned a common problem I see in women trying to become bikini confident. 

Women lack education and understanding around nutrition which causes serial yo yo dieting. 

To fix this problem, you need more nutrition education on how you can eat the foods you love and still get the results you deserve. 

Here's how it works: 

As a qualified nutritionist, I educate females on how to make good food choices to achieve their goals. I don't focus on short term quick fixes but long term sustainable results. I genuinely believe if you hand someone a diet plan you will only help them so far,  but if you educate them on a balanced lifestyle - this is invaluable.

Gemma has been active for years - she’s done lots of programmes and worked with PTs. 

Before we started working together Gemma would exercise and work with PTs but she never really saw any ‘gains’.

She hesitated in starting because ‘She wanted to weigh up all the options - financially - would it be worth it’. ‘She also had a fear of failure’. Although after her initial call, a plan was laid out and she felt super confident! 

'In terms of cost, it is definitely the best money I’ve ever spent and I’ve done lots of PTs over the years - they were all lovely but they weren’t what I needed’

Fast forward 6 months later and she fits into her work pants much easier. She has found it great in terms of her ‘own emotional well-being and her form’

They feel they have no time to go to the gym because they are too busy. 

Thankfully a lot of my clients train from home 3 times a week with minimal equipment. 

You see the thing is - you don't actually need hours in the gym to achieve your goals - especially if you're crazy busy. I also encourage women to make better choices if they are too busy to cook.

I've found that most people usually can find time. Maybe instead of an hour of Netflix we could swap it for a workout? Maybe instead of scrolling we could be walking? Or instead of picking up a takeaway on the way home from work, we could pick up a ready meal in a supermarket? The problem lies in trying to do too much.

12,2022-09-20 17:37:55+10:00,"🚀 How I became stronger, happier and more confident and how you can too. 

❌When I started in the fitness industry I was a little lost. I was focused on how I looked. I was obsessed with having abs. I only ate ‘clean’ food mid week which led to weekend binges. My relationship with nutrition and fitness definitely was not a healthy one. 

🚨I wasn’t happy. Not in my body. Not in my mind. I genuinely couldn’t imagine continuing my life with this level of restriction and I began to resent the gym 😢 I was tired and cranky and was constantly sick. I distinctly remember a time in final year college where I could not get rid of bronchitis - I was zapped constantly and I lost my place on the college football team! 

✅ Then I stopped focusing so much on HOW I looked. I stopped looking for abs every time I walked by the mirror. I started to appreciate resistance training and I began focusing on how much stronger I was becoming. My goals changed. Performance based goals replaced the quest for abs and I found my love for exercise again. I found a balanced approach to nutrition. I still eat very healthy and nutritious but I no longer restrict myself. 

🔥 I no longer focus on HOW I look but WHAT my body can do. I wear bikinis now without dieting to get in them. I’m stronger and fitter than I’ve ever been and clothes sizes no longer dictate my life. I’m happier and healthier. I love the skin I’m in ❤ Looking back on these pictures actually makes me incredibly sad. I see someone totally different to the person I’ve become! 🙏

Take a look at how some of my Strong and Sassy females did: 

- Simone’s (busy mum) habits are now as engrained as brushing her teeth

- Emily (new mum) lost 14kg and in her words ‘is in the best shape of her life’ 

- Michelle (busy professional) lost NOTHING on the scales but look at the change to her shape

I'm looking for a few specific things from my ladies. So if you: 

 🔥Are committed to finally changing your habits.
🔥Are able to train 3 times a week
🔥 Consider yourself to be coachable
🔥 And are ready to get pushed out of your comfort zone. 

Then just comment below with the words 'I'M IN' and I'll be choosing people today.

Being fit is hugely important to me. But fitness is pretty all rounded. I don’t just want to be able to lift weights and be out of breath walking up stairs.

One of the main reasons I love CrossFit is because it incorporates so many elements of fitness. I feel proud to have a body weight and a half back squat but also a 7.42 2km Row.

I set myself this challenge of completing a half marathon in sub 2 hours. With 13 runs in the bag over the last 2 months - it hit my target 🎯 

Thank you so much for all the well wishes and to everyone who donated to ‘Australian Cancer Research Foundation’.

✅ Have more energy
✅ Enjoy a good morning routine
✅ Not struggle lifting the groceries
✅ Look in the mirror and not hate what you see
✅ Try on clothes in a shop and feel good
✅ Rock a bikini at any time of year
✅ Lift more weights than your partner 🙊

A. Play sports
B. Lose weight

Here are some common problems I see -

1. When I started spending more time in the gym than on the pitch - I realised - the pitch was not for me anymore 🥲 (this probably won’t apply to an injured athlete)

2. Stop with all the volume - you SHOULDN’T have dead legs going to play your match if you have a sports specific programme. You are either doing too much volume (following a generic programme) or not recovering well enough.

3. Females in particular tend to have a tendency to underestimate when it comes to sports. If you’re not fuelling adequately - you’re putting your performance at major risk!

4. Sleep and hydration are the two most important factors for recovery. Worry about ice baths, massages and sleep when you have these nailed!

She initially wanted to lose 6kg, prioritise herself and feel better in herself - physically and mentally!

If you are choosing a long term sustainable lifestyle over a quick fix - no food is off limits ❌❌❌

So enjoying a little bit of chocolate or cake or jellies is more than ok 🙏

Personally, I opt for wholefood options over lower calorie options - so here's a list of some of my go to's 🙌 

Remember, at the end of the day, the food you consume needs to align with your goals if you want to see results. There is no point choosing 'healthier' options if fat loss is a goal and you're not tracking calories 🙈

Here’s so of my top tips

1. Find a programme that aligns with your goals. Progressively overload. Amen 🙏 
Random classes = random results.

2. Be consistent. You could have the best programme in the world but unless you’re actually being consistent with it - it’s useless. Don’t be disappointed with the results you didn’t achieve from the work you didn’t put in! 

3. Do the boring exercises. Squat, Hinge, Push, Pull, Lunge and Carry every week - and you’re onto a winner.

4. For consistency, enjoyment and fulfilment to happen - you need to have something you really enjoy in there too - for me that’s a metcon 😍

If you’re struggling to see results in the gym - there’s a number of reasons it may not be working for you. But make sure you’re putting in the work in the gym and in the kitchen before blaming the programme 🙊 I see this one very often. 🙊 And if you’re not happy or satisfied - there are always other options.

Strength training is NOT just about here and now - your future self is actually thanking you 🙏 

Why?

Because as we age our muscle mass and bone mass density declines, resistance training helps offset this otherwise dramatic loss of muscle and bone mineral density.

Evidence suggest resistance based training in cancer survivors is not only well-tolerated in cancer patients, but also a tool to counteract adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. 

Resistance training in youths is not only safe but is also a great way to prepare their bodies for the physical demands of sport.

Resistance training in athletes is a pivotal part of every sport.

So if resistance or strength training is so important to everyone - young, old, sick, or sporty - why isn’t everyone doing it? 🤔

Once upon a time, I based my worth on how I looked.  I restricted. I binged. I did every crunch known to man. I did hours of endless cardio. I punished myself with exercise. I acted like the most confident person in the world to hide how I really felt about myself 😭

Fast forward 8 years, I know that confidence means - it’s not trying to make people like you but being absolutely fine if they don’t 🙏 I’m happier, healthier, fitter and stronger than I’ve ever been ❤️ I’m so proud of my journey and how far I’ve come 💪

My new obsession is sharing - not only my knowledge, but my journey. It’s been a long road, but it’s a path best not walked alone ❤️🙏 If you want to become they healthiest, happiest, most confident version of yourself - I CAN HELP 🙋‍♀️

I have one coaching space left for August. Dm me - COACH 🫶

That's exactly what I said to myself when I saw this photo 🙌

.
.
1. Amino Acids are proteins building blocks and we NEED these for recovery. Remember recovery is not only essential if you train, our bodies recover every single day.

2. Satiety - every sit down to eat 3 chicken breasts? Doubtful because protein rich foods are so filling. They also help stabilise our blood sugars and reduce cravings. So get your protein in 👊

3. Thermic Effect from Food (TEF) - Did you know that TEF has the same effect on our TDEE as purposeful exercise? 🤔 Did you know protein actually requires more energy to break down than fats or carbohydrates? 🤔 So double whammy here 👊

3,2022-08-05 05:46:12+10:00,"5 Reasons you’re not achieving your results 🚨🚨

1. Lack of consistency - this is usually the main problem. Working hard Monday to Friday to blow it all at weekends. Strict rigid dieting for 6 weeks to blow it all for the 6 months afterwards. Consistency is KEY to achieving your results.

2. You are impatient - we want results yesterday 😖 As opposed to playing the long game with our health, we put a time line on it and expect our results to reflect that time line.

3. Your goals are totally unrealistic - Having abs as a female (for majority of females) requires two things.
A. An unhealthy body fat percentage 
B. Sacrifices most people are NOT willing to make to achieve it. 
So lower your expectations 🙏

4. What is your why? 
I want to lose weight is not enough. When the motivation is low - ‘I want to lose weight won’t cut it’. 

‘I want to feel amazing on my wedding day’ 
‘I want enough energy to play with my kids’
‘I want to feel comfortable in a bikini’ 
👆these will 👆

5. No roadmap to your goals - this is a very common one. A lot of people set off on their health and fitness journeys alone with no support or help. A majority fail - why? They have absolutely no guidance, no help and no clear cut roadmap to HOW they achieve their results.

Stop. With. The. Nonsense ✋

Just because a scale weight fluctuates this is not an excuse for you to throw in the towel.

Anyone who has ever played sport - if the other team scores do you just quit? No you continue playing until the end.

Unlike sport, your health and fitness should not have an end date or time. You should always be playing the long game and finding a sustainable approach to the person you want to become. 

And that person is NOT determined by a number on a scales.

So next time you want to have a breakdown that you’ve GAINED fat overnight - refer back to this post, hell throw out that scales if it has that much of an impact on your head. And remember, daily flucuations happen. It is not a reflection of your progress!

An area I know a lot of people struggle with is increasing protein in their diet. Based on the poll I put up yesterday - those who wanted more help - I’ve tagged you 🙋‍♀️

Main meals seem to be easier to get protein in but there's definitely a disconnect when it comes to protein snacks. Although keep an eye for protein in main meals too. 

While most people would have protein bars etc. Included in here - a lot of these options are highly processed and the protein quality is poor (I am NOT saying don't eat them. I would just not be relying heavily on them for protein sources).

A parcel arrived yesterday with some holiday and summer pieces and it got me thinking 🤔 

Things have changed so much in the last few years…

A few years ago, 4 weeks out from a holiday I would be cutting carbs and doing crunches for that bikini 👙 

Now, the bikini takes me as I am. ❤️

There is nothing WRONG with wanting to look and feel good in a bikini. Actually the total contrary I think it is VITALLY important for us. 

But contrary to what people think, being smaller DOES NOT equal happier 😱

If you are not happy in a bikini, you need to find out why 🤔 When you get to the root of it, more often than not you’ll realise the bikini was never the problem! 

I strived to be smaller and leaner. And at my smallest and leanest, I was still direly uncomfortable in a bikini 😱🥹

Now, I’m happy, healthy and strong. I’m at least a dress size bigger and sometimes I chaf 🙊 But, now putting on a bikini does not bother me.

I want to help women realise your dress size has nothing to do with your happiness. That scale weight is just one representation of progress. I want women to put on a bikini and stop worrying about how they look and focus more on how they feel ❤️

This is my mission. I’m already on the road to success. Who wants to join me? 🥂",50,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/295184417_567163561800241_7834060944720022640_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=rte5Ke85c-kAX8fw7Vm&_nc_oc=AQl04sYRllPojvE_TEwosY61CjApyY-OqVrdhYfyYCIT7vSYEHunGettv9UIIv1q3xbGfwzvyIEbKjeftPhqv3oW&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfBU1YxwJ3saQVB4vBBIma0ijxO_QT7bOVQVVjGMnC0QsQ&oe=64043731,https://www.instagram.com/p/CgVBFpfBzXn/,17847897368803588,,,,

Yep I overthink everything. I’ve a situation made up in my head, I have the whole story told to myself and it has about 10 endings - all of them negative 🙊😱 I’m working on this.

Do you overthink?

Do you write your own story. Do you tell yourself 
- I’m not good enough
- I’ll never be able
- I’m too old
- I’m not fit enough
- I could never look like that

If you DIDN’T overthink - what would be the outcome? What could the best possible case scenario be? 

Because let me tell you - YOU AND YOUR MIND are the ONLY things holding you back.

If you don’t try - that is the ONLY time you will fail. 

Quick story - once upon a time I studied to become a fitness instructor. I felt so far out of my depth at the gym with everyone that was there. We had to strength test. One of the tests was chin ups (I was no where NEAR being able to do a chin up) so the alternative was an inverted row. I couldn’t even do 1 inverted row. Last week, I did a workout with 15 Inverted Rows which I did WITH EASE!!!! 8 years later, the effort I have been putting in is coming to fruition.

1. Most important is frequency and volume 
✅ Pull Ups - Slow eccentrics, change grip, use Rings/Trx 
✅ Bench Press - Dumbbell Press, Floor Press, Push Ups, Inclince Press

You need to be hitting some form of these movements AT LEAST twice a week to progress.

2. Assistance Exercises 
It’s not all about doing more and more volume. Are you doing other back exercises to build a strong back? Do you neglect isolation exercises? 
A good programme will incorporate all of the above.

3. Nutrition for performance
If you are not eating enough, of course performance will suffer. Eat to fuel your body 🥦🍏🍉🥑🍚

Fat gets a bad rep. 
Sure it is 9Kcal per gram but it is an essential part of a balanced fat. 
.
.
Fats provide us with energy, makes up our cell membranes of our brain and nervous system. Fats are necessary to transport vitamins A,D,E and K and make and balance certain hormones.
.
.
Dietary Fat can be found in 2 forms:
Saturated – mainly found in animal products like meat, dairy, eggs, coconut
Unsaturated – found in marine sources like fish oils, as well as nuts, seeds and vegetable oils
.
. 
For years saturated fat was thought to be associated with higher risk of Cardiovascular Disease and so it was deemed as ‘unhealthy’ or ‘bad for you’. The problem with saturated fat was not the actual fat itself but rather the increased consumption of processed food or the large quantities of saturated fat products. Saturated fat helps increase the cholesterol production in the body which is an essential part of metabolism and in the production of steroid hormones. So saturated fat should feature in our diet, just maybe don’t latter every meal in butter.
.
. 
Unsaturated fats are made up of mono and polyunsaturated fats.  These contain our omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids. Omega 3 fatty acids open our airways and blood vessels. They reduce our blood lipids and cholesterol and lower inflammation and pain. Omega 6 fatty acids do the opposite. Both are needed in the body, without both we wouldn’t heal or recover from exercise. The problem with Western diets is that we don’t have the proper ratios. We are at about 10:1 where we should be at 2:1 (omega 6/omega 3).
.
. 
Low fat diets were a fad a few years ago. While people reduced calories, they increased their intake of processed foods. Diets lacked fats and fat soluble vitamins so instead of being healthier people were losing weight but were not healthier.
.
. 
Fats are an essential part of any healthy diet. Be aware that they are very calorie dense so portion control may be important and don’t opt for processed versions. Enjoy them as part of a balanced lifestyle.

19,2022-06-21 05:44:07+10:00,"By saying yes to something - you are ultimately saying no to something else.

I’ll give you a little example - at the weekend I had a CrossFit competition - it meant I had to say no to a friends birthday on Saturday.

For years and years, I gave up all my social Occassions to say yes to playing football.

I used to be a yes person. I would say yes to everything - I’d help everyone.
At one stage when I lived at home I was:
Managing a gym, looking after my mother who was in hospital, playing football with Roscommon and Garrycastle, helping train Roscommon u14 girls AND Garrycastle Minor girls 😵‍💫🥴 That’s not to mention trying to spend time with my partner and friends.

I learned how to say no from working with a life coach and it was one of the best things I’ve ever learned to do. I encourage and promote saying no to things with my clients too.

Saying no has added benefits - not only are you NOT doing what you don’t WANT to do but you end up saying yes to what you do want.

An example of saying no. Last bank holiday weekend I refused to make plans - I wanted to just go with the flow - see what happened, I ultimately wanted to chill. I said no to making plans and in turn I had a lovely chilled, relaxed weekend 🫶

Here are some of my top tips:
❌ Stop using coffee as an appetite suppressant 
🚫 Does having a little milk in your coffee break your fast? Who cares 🙊
❌ Stop abusing it - do you need 17 cups a day - highly unlikely
🚫 More coffee ≠ more energy (quite often over consumption of coffee will lead to you feeling burnt out and tired)
❌ Stop drinking it in the afternoon - I don’t care if you say ‘it doesn’t affect me’ - it most likely DOES affect your sleep quality

✅ Enjoy in moderation 
✅ If you have a sensitive stomach - perhaps eat before your morning coffee

I have Sundays free…
I don’t feel like I have 2 jobs…

So honestly, no I don’t miss the sport.

That’s not to say I don’t miss the people ❤️

But I still get the team training environment. I still eat, sleep and train like an athlete.
And I have so much more free time and control of what I do.

I don’t regret playing football. It was some of the best years of my life. And some of the life skills I’ve learned - I owe to football. But for me, the fire quenched a long time before quitting. 

If there is a part of your life, you’re not happy with. You have full control of changing it.

I didn’t quit football out of fear of not being ‘Amanda the footballer’ anymore. It was actually such an engrained part of my character. And now, the people I’ve met in Australia have never even met that person 😅

❌ You wouldn’t put the wrong fuel into your car? Why? It’d damage the engine? 

❌ You wouldn’t let your battery go dead on your phone? Why? Because you need your phone!

By choosing to make poor food choices, drink too much alcohol and not drink enough water - we are choosing to fill our bodies with the ‘wrong fuel’. By choosing to not prioritise sleep and be sedentary, we have no energy. 

The choices you make daily shape and align the person you become.

It doesn’t matter how slow you are going - forward is forward - 10km/h or 100 km/h you will still get to your destination 🫶

Quitting or stopping is the only way we don’t get there 🫣

I had the CrossFit Open, Quarter Finals, I did the Age Group QF, an in house comp, a Spartan race and an in person comp. On top of that I had a crazy social life along with a trip to Melbourne and Brisbane.

.
.
I pride myself on it actually. I've alway been a pro choice kinda girl in all aspects of life (not just health and fitness related). You'll never hear me boast about one type of diet or slate any either. You won't hear me downgrade any form of exercise, although I do openly talk about the huge benefits of resistance training 💪 I'll never tell any of my client's 'you cannot eat this for weight loss'. If someone who loves yoga comes to me, I'm not going to force them to lift weights. And if someone who is vegan comes to me, I would not force them to eat animal products. My problem with any of these things lies in the misinformation. 
.
.
Did you know that vegan fast food production has sky rocketed in recent years? 🤔 Similarly, a few years ago, gluten free products were a huge trend? And before that, sugar free was the hype? This I have a problem with.
.
.
Veganism is a lifestyle choice. I have huge respect for anyone's lifestyle choices, whether they conform to my own is irrelevant. What actually annoys me is actual vegans are getting a terrible name due to all these people jumping on the bandwagon, thinking veganism is the healthiest lifestyle going. People are going into this lifestyle, uneducated and naive. 😒 It was the same a few years ago when gluten free was the buzzword. Did you know you can have a totally adequate, balanced, healthy diet without adding one gluten free product? And thats for ACTUAL coeliacs out there, because they are the ONLY people that need to be eating gluten free toast 😂
.
.
What my very long winded post is trying to say is stop jumping on bandwagons. If you are and always have been vegan, that's fine. Continue with your choices. If you are coeliac, continue with your gluten free bread 🙈 
.
For the rest of you, stop following trends by the latest celebrity diet.
❎ Stop conforming to social norms ✊ 
❎Stop basing your beliefs on a bloody stupid documentary 😒 
✅Get some advice from a professional. 🙏
✅ Follow said advice 🌈 
✅ And unfollow anyone giving terrible, uneducated advice

- Eibhlin (busy mum) changed the shape of her body and she has never been stronger 

- Aine lost kilos on the scales and added kilos on the barbell

- Are committed to finally changing your habits.
- Are able to train 3 times a week
- Consider yourself to be coachable
- And are ready to get pushed out of your comfort zone.

1. Being consistently good is better than being occasionally perfect.

2. The weekend makes up a large part of the week. If you think you’re being good during the week and not making progress - take a look at your weekends.

3. Sleep is one of the most underestimated tools to help you achieve ANY goal. If you’re sleep is shit and you’re sacrificing it ‘to seize the morning’ and train at 6am - you may be doing more harm than good.

4. Water consumption is the simplest way to becoming a healthier version of yourself. Stop looking at fad diets, detox teas, apple cider vinegar and look at your hydration status. Dehydration affects every system in our body and can lead to lack of energy, low mood, injury and brain fog (to mention afew).

5. Human connection, vitamin D and exercise are some of the most under utilised mental health prescriptions. Try increase all of these on the daily to see an instant mood shift 🙏

6. Stop trying to be a people pleaser and learn to say no - you are your own most important asset. 

7. Live every day like it’s your last ❤️ Do what makes you happy!

👉 Instead of trying to ‘eat clean’ why not find an 80/20 balance and count calories 

👉 Instead of trying to exercise more - sleep more

Unfortunately, to gain alcohol - calories had to be taken away somewhere and protein has taken a little hit in this day.

- Trish lost inches and kilos while looking after her 2 kids

5,2022-05-07 16:06:56+10:00,"Yesterday, I mentioned a common problem i see in women trying to become bikini confident. 

Women lack education and understanding around nutrition which causes serial yo yo dieting. 

To fix this problem, you need more nutrition education on how you can eat the foods you love and still get the results you deserve. 

Here's how it works: 

As a qualified nutritionist, I educate females on how to make good food choices to achieve their goals. I don't focus on short term quick fixes but long term sustainable results. I genuinely believe if you hand someone a diet plan you will only help them so far,  but if you educate them on a balanced lifestyle - this is invaluable.

💥 If you are a student, unsure of your path. Please talk to a career guidance teacher.
💥 If you are unsure of your career and thinking about changing everything for a different route. Maybe you could see a life coach.
💥 If you are sick. See a doctor.
💥 If you are having mental health issues, a counsellor may be an option
💥 If you're having car troubles, go to a mechanic.
💥 If your phone isn't working, bring it to a phone shop.

Eibhlin is a 42 year old busy mum of 3. She wanted to do my Strong and Sassy programme as has a big holiday coming up in June and ‘wanted to feel stronger and more confident’.

Before we started working together, Eibhlin had been through a few lockdowns, had developed some bad nutrition habits and had lost a lot of fitness. With her holiday looming, she wanted to gain structure as well as get fitter and stronger. 

She delayed a little in reaching out to me as she wasn’t 100% ready but as soon as she did - she signed up straight away - knowing this was the right programmme for her. 

‘The app is great and I realise I actually love working out on my own! I can do it in my time and the programme is tailored to me’

Fast forward 2 months and Eibhlin cannot believe the change in her progress photos. She had no originally joined for weight loss but is pleasantly surprised by the secondary effects of an overall healthy lifestyle.

10,2022-05-05 05:03:00+10:00,"Yesterday I told you about time being a problem for women trying to change their body shape. They feel they can't give full commitment to a programme because they are too busy. 

They feel they have no time to go to the gym because they are too busy. 

Thankfully a lot of my clients train from home 3 times a week with minimal equipment. 

You see the thing is - you don't actually need hours in the gym to achieve your goals - especially if you're crazy busy. I also encourage women to make better choices if they are too busy to cook. And instead of scrolling on Social media - I set step targets for them (even if they scroll while they walk). 

You see - it's pretty simple. Try this out and let me know how it goes.

11,2022-05-04 18:40:23+10:00,"Another common problem I see most women have when they are trying to change their body shape is time to commit to a programme. 

We all lead such busy lifestyles these days. We give time to our families, our friends, and work and we are left with little to no time. 

It's so frustrating because you're trying to be a good friend, mother, daughter, sister, colleague, or employee. But what's left for you? Or maybe there is time? 

I've found that most people usually can find time. Maybe instead of an hour of Netflix we could swap it for a workout? Maybe instead of scrolling we could be walking? Or instead of picking up a takeaway on the way home from work, we could pick up a ready meal in a supermarket? The problem lies in trying to do too much.

12,2022-05-04 05:46:31+10:00,"How Helen changed her habits and became more confident over 12 weeks. 

Helen has been training on and off for years. Her main goal was to get into a good routine and be accountable. She was looking for a long term sustainable change - without restriction. 

Before we started working together Helen did programmes and trained - but as soon as she had a bad week or didn’t see the scales moving - she gave up. She found herself unhappy in her clothes and she was sick of stopping and starting. 

She hesitated in starting because of pride ‘She thought she could and should do it alone’. And if she's honest, she thought ‘I know what to do’. But she realised she needed direction, accountability and a community - which drove her to take action.

'I knew others who did Amanda’s programme and I knew it had a personal approach' ‘I knew there was a community environment to it and I liked that’

Fast forward 12 weeks and she feels so much happier and more confident.

'This programme is for anyone who is lacking direction’

13,2022-05-03 16:20:39+10:00,"How I became stronger, happier and more confident and how you can too. 

When I started in the fitness industry I was a little lost. I was focused on how I looked. I was obsessed with having abs. I only ate 'clean' food mid week which led to weekend binges. My relationship with nutrition and fitness definitely was not a healthy one. 

I wasn't happy. Not in my body. Not in my mind. I genuinely couldn't imagine continuing my life with this level of restriction and I began to resent the gym 😢 

Then I stopped focusing so much on HOW I looked. I stopped looking for abs every time I walked by the mirror. I started to appreciate resistance training and I began focusing on how much stronger I was becoming. My goals changed. Performance based goals replaced the quest for abs and I found my love for exercise again. I found a balanced approach to nutrition. I still eat very healthy and nutritious but I no longer restrict myself. 

I no longer focus on HOW I look but WHAT my body can do. I wear bikinis now without dieting to get in them. I'm stronger and fitter than I've ever been and clothes sizes no longer dictate my life. I'm happier and healthier. I love the skin I'm in ❤ 

And that's why I created my Strong and Sassy Programme to help women become bikini confident year round without restrictions.

No matter what diet they do, they can't stick to it at weekends.... 

To fix this problem I get my clients to find their non negotiables. 

What are non negotiables?
They are habits you can stick to NO MATTER WHAT the circumstances are. 

I usually recommend 3 of them.. 

3 things you can stick to every weekend.
For example - Drink 2 litres of water, walk 10,000 steps daily and 1 piece of fruit.

You may notice yourself cutting calories during the week and then all hell breaks lose at weekends and you're afraid that if you continue this way you'll never achieve that bikini body 😢 

It's so frustrating because you're really trying to make a change. What's actually causing this is a binge restrict cycle that you've developed over the years. We only know and understand nutrition at 2 levels - 'really good' or 'really bad' 

I've found the best solution to fix this is to SAY NO to the all or nothing approach - but this will require help. Accountability to someone who knows what they're talking about can definitely help with this. I've also found having non negotiables proves very helpful.

I’ve had a busy April 🫠 Between the F1, Easter and Owen’s birthday my body has been through the ringer 😵🙊

The first 3 months of the year were very much training and competition focused so it’s very important to me I get a good balance between training and socialising (at the end of the day - I’m not a full time athlete 😅) 

April has been my busiest month since January and I’m so excited to be helping clients get bikini confident for Summer 🙏(life is finally getting back to normality and holidays are back on the cards 🥳) Some of my clients will be wearing a bikini with confidence this year for 'THE FIRST TIME EVER'!!!!!! Mind blowing 🥳🤯

.
.
When people said to Arnold Schwarzenegger 
'Oh but I don't want to look like you.'

He replied:
'Don't worry. You never will.'
.
.
Let me tell you. Building muscle is BLOODY HARD. You don't just wake up one day and 'are bulky' 😅😅😅
.
.
I've spent YEARS improving myself and getting stronger, fitter and healthier. That is my goal. So don't think after lifting afew weights you're going to gain 10kg of muscle and look 'bulky'. And honestly, most people will NEVER EVER train as hard as I train 😅 
.
.
But let me also tell you. Majority of the photos I take are mid or post training when I have a serious pump. In normal clothes, I'm a normal size 8-10 female. I don't have jacked quads or a shoulder vein 😅 (Even though I'd be happy to walk around like that)
.
.
Moral of the story: most people will never train hard enough to get bulky. Most people don't walk round jacked 😅 The 'toned' look you want is actually muscle - so if you say you want to be 'toned' and don't want muscle you're actually contradicting yourself 😅

Oh and if it wasn't already obvious - lift weights 🏋‍♀️

Not only is resistance based training optimal for a fat loss goal but it also increases lean muscle mass and bone mineral density - I call that BANG for your buck 💸

- Bernie changed the shape of her body and became more educated on nutrition

- Teresa lost kilos on the scales and added kilos on the barbell

- Are committed to finally changing your habits.
- Are able to train 3 times a week
- Consider yourself to be coachable
- And are ready to get pushed out of your comfort zone.

17,2022-03-30 16:42:45+11:00,"Why are you so anti weight loss? 🤔

LET’S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT. I am NOT anti weight loss. I am pro health. If weight loss is going to make you healthier - I am ALL for it 🙋‍♀️

But let’s get one thing straight. Weight loss ≠ happiness. 

Let me tell you something personal - that not many people know/realise.

When I was younger, I dressed to impress. Not myself but others. I craved attention so much, I wore clothes to reflect the amount of attention I knew I’d receive. I made out that I was this confident queen when inside I was falling apart 😢

Fast forward to now - I dress for me 💃 I feel like the belle of the ball when I wear something that shows off my strong, healthy body ❤️ 

My point - I don’t look much different from then until now. But my mindset - poles apart. 🙏

So I will reiterate - Health is and always will be my number 1 priority - physical and mental. Being happy, comfortable and confident is a really difficult place to get to and no scale weight or clothes size will measure that. 

Everyday I am changing people’s lives - scales drop as a bi product of a healthier lifestyle. But their happiness, confidence and self worth is the goal 🦋🙌

If you’re interested in becoming the healthiest, happiest, most confident version of yourself.

✅Workout 5 - Those snatches 🏋️‍♀️

NO lowlights - but always things to learn.

👉 Gymnastics is my big focus for the next few months

2. Satiety - every sit down to eat 3 chicken breasts? Doubtful because protein rich foods are so filling. They also help stabilise our blood sugars and reduce cravings. So get your protein in 👊

3. Thermic Effect from Food (TEF) - Did you know that TEF has the same effect on our TDEE as purposeful exercise? 🤔 Did you know protein actually requires more energy to break down than fats or carbohydrates? 🤔 So double whammy here 👊

This one is important.

For those of you who don’t know - my Dad died of pancreatic cancer aged 50 (5 days before his 51st birthday).

Since his death, two things have been hugely prominent in my life - 
1. Your health is your wealth 
2. I was put on this Earth to help people 

Yesterday I paid almost $600 on blood tests. The receptionist asked me ‘Are you sure you want this one? It’s the most expensive’ (the blood test in Question was related to my Dads condition which I want to do any test for that I can). 
I actually couldn’t believe she asked me that 🤔 But I realised people have probably declined to pay that price. I’m not gonna lie the price came as a shock to me, and I had to fiddle between bank accounts to hand it over. But never ONCE did it cross my mind to not pay. You see to me, my health is priceless. I am willing to invest or hand over WHATEVER I need to, to ensure I am as healthy as I possibly can be. And to me, that money was a NECESSITY! 

I cannot believe people put a price on their health 😱 Your health literally is your wealth! 

That brings me to my second realisation. I need to help as many women as possible in this world to realise your health is your wealth. Not just physical, but mental too. 
⛔️Hating your body is not healthy
⛔️ Constant dieting is not healthy
⛔️ Exercising to burn calories is not healthy
⛔️ Trying to look like someone else is not healthy

I want to educate women about nutrition without restriction. I want to help women become the healthiest, happiest, most confident versions of themselves ❤️🙏

Here are some examples of meals I used to eat on the go. (P.S I still eat a lot of these types of meals because convenience is key for me 😜) but luckily now I get @hunger_gains_ - convenience and amazing tasting healthy food. Win win 🥳🙋‍♀️

All of these require minimal time and effort. And you knit pick and say 'Packet bought chicken isn't the healthiest?' Well Susan... it's better than that sausage roll you reached for last week 🙈😅

Oh if only I had her legs 🤔

.
Why does she have a washboard stomach and I don't 😭
.
.
Omg would she ever cover up. Who does she think she is 🙀

I was so obsessed with comparing myself to other women. I was so certain if I looked like other people I would be happier in my own body. I was indoctrinated. I used to look up Owen's exes for Christ sake and compare myself 😅 (Just so you know if any of you follow me 😅). 
.
.
So how did I get to present day Amanda? My God it took time and a lot of effort. Took some counselling too 🤟 Becoming happy comfortable and confident in my body took gratitude, talking to myself and listening to a lot of positive self help books. 
.
.
I started to appreciate how incredible my body is. Not for what it looks like but what it can do. And after that changed, so did my whole outlook.
.
.
I still get a little envious (of a good tan 😍😍😍) but I'm pretty darn happy with my body. I no longer compare it to smaller waist sizes. I'm not upset any more that I have a little pouch (that's my happiness pouch). 
.
.
I'm proud of my body. And you should be too ❤

P.s Appreciating a rocking body is different 😍 I'm allllllll about that
👊 But I'm happy in my own 👊

Elaine came to me as a footballer with goals to prevent injury and get stronger.

‘I don’t want to take them every 2 weeks because I know if I don’t see results I’ll get disheartened. I’m happy with how I’m doing and I don’t need justification through photos’.

If we are happier, more confident, feel better it HAS an impact on husbands, partners and children.

Here are some of the implications that have happened because of my coaching:

‘Nicole felt great in a dress she wore at the weekend. Her boyfriend thought it was lovely to not hear her give out about herself for once’. 

‘Colleen’s husband was so proud of her for throwing out her weighing scales’

‘Karen’s daughter does her stretching and burpees with her’

Find yourself a new coach 👊

One of the saddest things I hear from females is past experiences with old coaches 😢 I’ve had numerous women who had been made feel like a failure because ‘They weren’t losing enough/expected amount of weight on scale each week’. ‘They were made to feel like they failed’

Ok coaches look I get it - a woman comes to you with one goal you want to help her achieve said goal. 

My approach with women is a little less hardcore. I’ve developed a soft spot. I think it’s important that if a female has not achieved her desired result you educate her on why this possibly occurred. Then, focus on what did happen over that time period - all the positives they achieved 🙏

My approach is ‘yes weight loss can and will occur but let’s focus on enjoying exercise, educating ourselves on nutrition and finding a lifestyle we can sustain forever.

Firstly, do you track your period? Do you even know when your period is due? If not, why not?
Cycles are a very important part of a woman's life and a lot of elements can be affected at different phases of our cycle and not just our hormones 🙀 💥Have you ever noticed you're more productive at certain times? 
💥 Noticed you're stronger at certain times?
💥 Is your sleep affected at certain times? 
What gets measured gets managed 👊👊👊
.
.
OK, so you've started tracking...
And you notice, ok my cycle length is a lot longer than normal (21-35 days). You know you're not pregnant (immaculate conception 😇). So what could it be?
.

There are many factors that may contribute to your irregular cycle.

Comfort zones are great. Spending ‘most’ of your time there is fine - normal if you will. But if you want to grow you need to get out of that comfort zone.

Today I did just that. For a girl that is afraid to rock climb with a harness on, I was on clawing my way up a mountain today 😱

Ever heard the sayings -
 ‘Nothing changes if nothing changes 🤷‍♀️’

Or

‘If you want a different result - make a different choice’

When was the last time you ventured outside that comfort zone!?

❇️Maybe it was quitting a job you hate without having another opportunity lined up?
❇️Maybe it starting a new sport
❇️Maybe it was having a cold shower
❇️Maybe it was trying a new food
❇️Maybe it was speaking on instagram stories
❇️Maybe it was travelling

The list goes on…

I encourage you all to do it. It’s something I try to do multiple times a week (I’d like to say daily but I don’t think I do it that often). 
Adrenaline is an important hormone in our body and it is encouraged to release it (nobody is saying you have to sign up for an ultra marathon or live in the Antarctic).

Original Goal when you started with me?

- Improve relationship with food, feel better in myself, lose weight

Largest Obstacle/ Problem separating you from achieving that goal?

-Lack of understanding with nutrition, exercise

How do you feel I helped you overcome the problem?

-Education with nutrition, even though I struggled with exercise due to factors out of my control, my relationship with food and the improvements I made still resulted in a weight loss but more importantly improved mood, improved skin, more energy and overall mental health is much better.",11,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/273977141_294096162711948_7557838876069324297_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=yTn811xpH0cAX_PGY7D&_nc_oc=AQkaN59GsoNcrox6-C_AbQxbRM6X1zzfPtPJfZHZmQL5ZjC86BbL-z56kkoWIG7hjjA0lUQnQEHvSKCebulSDSrp&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfDKY6n2yjCqqYVDVlVbm5lLjOsiQo_zl3-P3BMna6mN-g&oe=640539C0,https://www.instagram.com/p/CaApbbWhCkF/,18048702646310213,,,,

Here's a reminder that the number 1 love in your life should be yourself 💕

Let's take this opportunity to appreciate, be happy and confident in our own bodies- no matter their shape or size 🙏 

Let's start normalising positive self image instead of tearing ourselves down all the time. Note: you'd never say to friends the things you'd say to yourself😑

Let's stop worrying about a 'bad weekend' and understand living is part of your life 🤦‍♀️

I celebrate client wins every single week. I now even do a coaching call every month dedicated to client wins 🥳 Why? Because I need to celebrate how God damn incredible my clients are AND they need to realise how amazing they are too 🥰💃

Unfortunately, especially as females we tend to focus heavily on what we CAN'T do or all the WRONG we do. We never give ourselves a pat on the back or celebrate all we CAN do 🥳💪 So I want to change that ✅

Wins are not always MASSIVE. Although shout out to Aine who will be completing a half marathon at the weekend 🏃‍♀️

Take a look through some of my clients wins this week.

- Picture 1 - Hitting calories and Protein through a Vegan diet ✅

- Picture 2 - I don't TELL my clients what to do when it comes to nutrition. I educate them and let them make their own decisions. Helen decided to be disciplined and chose just to have water at the cinema. Juliet opted for salads to chips. These are all DECISIONS made by clients. 

- Picture 3 - My coaching is MORE than just nutrition and training. Being organised has a knock on effect on your mental health. I try to encompass and encourage a Hollistic approach to health 🙏 Rest and Recovery are absolutely vital for our body. As I have a lot of athletes, it is so important not only their nutrition and training is on point but that they know how to recovery properly ✅

In Fact if anything I think you're a little more courageous 
🤩🤩🤩
.
.
You are not expected to know everything. That's why people have occupations with the relevant knowledge and skills to help 👌
.
.
💥 If you are a student, unsure of your path. Please talk to a career guidance teacher.
💥 If you are unsure of your career and thinking about changing everything for a different route. Maybe you could see a life coach.
💥 If you are sick. See a doctor.
💥 If you are having mental health issues, a counsellor may be an option
💥 If you're having car troubles, go to a mechanic.
💥 If your phone isn't working, bring it to a phone shop.
.
.
See the trend???
.

Once upon a time I thought I was totally independent. I didn't want to ask for help from anyone!!! But then I realised, I can't do it all alone and actually support and guidance is the best thing I could get. NOW, I ask for help all the time. From family, friends, and colleagues. I have a coach. If my mental health is affecting me I call someone for help. One of the best things I ever did was see a life coach ❤
.

Why is it so hard for people to see the same applies to training and nutrition? 🥴🥴🥴 You could be spending weeks, months or even years trying to do it alone? 🙈 Wasting your time and money in the process. If you aren't qualified in the area. YOU CAN ALWAYS ASK FOR HELP 🙏 Please please stop making poor nutrition choices based on what Google told you. Stop wasting time trying to 'shred belly fat' based on a free workout Susan gave you.

Ask for help. Stop wasting your time. I'm literally just a phone call away.

If you are choosing a long term sustainable lifestyle over a quick fix - no food is off limits ❌❌❌

So enjoying a little bit of chocolate or cake or jellies is more than ok 🙏

Personally, I opt for wholefood options over lower calorie options - so here's a list of some of my go to's 🙌 

Remember, at the end of the day, the food you consume needs to align with your goals if you want to see results. There is no point choosing 'healthier' options if fat loss is a goal and you're not tracking calories 🙈

Original Goal
Lose fat and build a better relationship with food and exercise 

How do you think I've helped you
With the knowledge and understanding I’ve learned from Amanda I can make the same (yummy and exciting) meals as pre-coaching but within my daily macros. My habits or non negotiables are drilled into me (and those close to me) 🤣 ie STEPS!! water, fruit and veg etc… basics but make such a difference once they are a must EVERYDAY and not just when you feel like it. I’m also subconsciously so much more aware of the different weekly habits I learned like getting enough protein, varied protein sources, eating colour, reading food labels if they have 10’s of ingredients etc etc 

Why you chose to work with me over someone else?
Your Passion and enthusiasm! Also so helpful if having a bad week: never judgey, always give relatable advice and very kind. So good at giving us perspective when being hard on ourselves.

People tend to do exactly the OPPOSITE of what I preach 🤣 I don't believe in the ALL OR NOTHING approach and that's exactly what people tend to do 🙈

✅ Feel like they've failed because they can't sustain 6 days of exercise a week and 1200 cals daily 🤦‍♀️
✅ Back drinking every 2nd night. 

In my camp, since January 1st: 

- Aine O had a big trip away and 'felt great in her clothes'
- Aine L has dropped 4kg and is back running again
- Anna has got her first EVER push ups
- Post partum Colleen is back bossing her training 
- Helen is feeling the 'happiest she has been in a long time'
- Maeve's work uniform is feeling looser
- Raychel's nutrition is improving daily
- Susan is already feeling stronger physically and mentally.
- Zac weighed in at an all time low 

NO CRAZY RESTRICITIONS 

NO ALCOHOL BANS
NO FOOD IS OFF LIMITS
NO TRAINING 6 DAYS A WEEK

What I've learned over the last 8 years in the fitness industry:
.
.
People THINK eating better, exercising  more and losing weight will make them feel better. 
.
.
What ACTUALLY makes people feel better is healing their relationships with food and exercise. And absolutely no shape, size or weight will make you feel better unless you're happy and content within yourself 🙏

When people said to Arnold Schwarzenegger 
'Oh but I don't want to look like you.'

He replied:
'Don't worry. You never will.'
.
.
Let me tell you. Building muscle is BLOODY HARD. You don't just wake up one day and 'are bulky' 😅😅😅
.
.
I've spent YEARS improving myself and getting stronger, fitter and healthier. That is my goal. So don't think after lifting afew weights you're going to gain 10kg of muscle and look 'bulky'. And honestly, most people will NEVER EVER train as hard as I train 😅 
.
.
But let me also tell you. Majority of the photos I take are mid or post training when I have a serious pump. In normal clothes, I'm a normal size 8-10 female. I don't have jacked quads or a shoulder vein 😅 (Even though I'd be happy to walk around like that)
.
.
Moral of the story: most people will never train hard enough to get bulky. Most people don't walk round jacked 😅 The 'toned' look you want is actually muscle - so if you say you want to be 'toned' and don't want muscle you're actually contradicting yourself 😅

Oh and if it wasn't already obvious - lift weights 🏋‍♀️

P.s Those tan lines though 😅

An area I know a lot of people struggle with is increasing protein in their diet. Main meals seem to be easier to get protein in but there's definitely a disconnect when it comes to protein snacks.

While most people would have protein bars etc. Included in here - a lot of these options are highly processed and the protein quality is poor (I am NOT saying don't eat them. I would just not be relying heavily on them for protein sources).

I know you THINK the latest trend or fancy exercises is what will get you the physique you want - truth is most people don't spend long enough at one thing to get their desired results 🤷‍♀️
.
.
I tend to write about the 'fun' metcons I do. But they accompany and are ADDITIONAL to the strength work I do 🙏
.
.
So stop looking for the next best thing. The best thing is right in front of you - it's the basics. Oh and this time stick at it for life 💪

Sick of chicken and broccoli? 🤔
.
.
You will quickly run out of ideas if you try to change whole meals so why not change up the sides 💁‍♀️
.
.
From my experience, people tend to like certain foods. If you stick with the foods you like, you're more likely to stick with it 🙏 
.
.
So my advice:
- Change the vegetables - not just the type but how you cook them - stir fry, boil, steam, roast. 

- Change the carb source - sick of brown rice? Add quinoa or cous cous! Sick of potato, try sweet potato.

- Rotate Week 1 - Chicken and pork based meals. Week 2 - Tofu and tuna based meals. Week 3 - Turkey & Salmon based meals. Week 4 - Prawn & Beef based meals. And start the cycle again 🙌

.
.
If you haven't already noticed I feel very passionate about helping people. 
.
.
I too, disliked my body image, under fuelled and exercised to burn calories. I too did endless amounts of cardio and crunches in a bid to find abs. And guess what, nothing changed. How I felt about myself didn't change one single bit. Even when I was a size 6 and probably <18% BF with visible abs, I still wasn't happy. 
.
.
And you won't be either, unless you deal with what's going on in your head and understand the 
Importance of your why. 
.
.
My 𝙬𝙝𝙮 is to be a role model 🙋‍♀️ I want younger girls to look up to me. I want peers to understand the message I am preaching. I want older women to see that fad diets and restriction is NOT the answer. I want Dad's to say 'You should listen to that Mc Loone one' (if you know you know 😅).
.
.
My 𝙬𝙝𝙮 is to help as many women as I can become the best versions of themselves. 
💥I want to educate women that you can still enjoy the food you like and be happy. 
💥I want women to see how empowering it is to become physically stronger. 
💥I want to help women see how incredible they are and stop focusing so much on how they look on the outside and see what they have to offer from the inside. 
💥I want to see confidence radiating from the women I work with. 
.
.
I truely believe I was put on this planet for 3 reasons:
1. To help as many people as physically possible.
2. To become the fittest and healthiest version of myself
3. To have loads of animals

Instead of breaking it down to basics and nailing the basics - every year people start off all guns blazing on January 1st with a list of 7 million things to do:
- Drink Detox juices
- Hiit training daily 
- 10,000 Steps
- 1200 Calories
- High Protein foods
- No Carbs
-No sugar
- No alcohol

Would you believe it if I said from that list I only encourage 2 of those with clients?

Would you believe if you don't want to - you never have to do a burpee for the rest of your life?

What if I told you I had a client who lost 30.7kg (yes you heard me right) in 1 year from nailing the basics:
✔ 3 resistance sessions a week
✔ Drink 2L water 
✔ Sleep adequately (this is still her Achilles heel but it's a heck of a lot better)
✔ 10,000 Steps
✔ Focus on food quality 
While still:
✅ Eating the foods she enjoys
✅ Drinking Alcohol
✅ Enjoying the exercise she does

.
.
When people say to me they 'want to lose weight', more often than not - it's fat loss they are actually seeking. And there is a difference 👆
.
.
Weight loss is a combination of fat, muscle and water. When people go on very restrictive diets they often see a huge scale shift on week 1 due to a reduction in total body water - as opposed to fat loss. 
.
.
If people focus solely on scale loss unfortunately there is likely to be muscle mass loss - which is what we don't want. As far as I'm aware some diet clubs actually discourage resistance training as it will lead to muscle gain (and essentially an increase on the scales) 🙈
.
.
Ladies, please please understand smaller ≠ happier 🚫
.
.
If someone is overweight/obese, weight loss should be the goal to a healthier overall body composition 🙏
.
.
Anyone else - Fat Loss is what you should be seeking 👆

If you're a female who wants to be bikini confident year round in 12 weeks, then now is your last chance to apply. 

I'd hate for you to miss out on results like these:

- Aoibheann lost 5kg in 12 weeks
- Sarah is now benching her old 1RM for 10 reps
- Trish lost inches and kilos while looking after her 2 kids

So - the decision is up to you, and it's super easy to apply.

But there are only a few hours left to apply.

.
.
I went through a really hard period of my life after my Dad died. As the oldest of his daughters I felt a responsibility to keep my shit together, look after my mother and sister and keep up appearances. It was a struggle. I tried to do this while managing a gym, commuting, playing with 2 football teams, studying, trying to maintain friendships and a relationship. I felt like I was just surviving as opposed to living 😢
.
.
And then I took control of my life. I started to look after myself first and everybody else's needs and wants came second. 
.
.
The meaning of the tattoo is that even the most beautiful things can come from the ugliest of places. 🙏
.
.
I'm not alone. I know we've all had struggles and strifes in our lives. I'm not saying mine has been harder than anyone else's. But I decided to take control of mine. I asked for help. I seeked the help I needed. And I made life changing decisions 💔❤
