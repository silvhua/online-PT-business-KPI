Look at this infographic, including the legend. “RT” stands for resistance training (”weight training”, or exercises targetting muscles) and “AT” stands for aerobic training (”cardio”).

Notice that of the 8 categories of exercise benefits, 7 can be obtained from resistance exercise. Only cardiorespiratory function is unique to aerobic training.

Resistance training is essential for strength and preventing age-related muscle and bone loss, yet many exercisers don’t do it. Hopefully infographics such as this one help people learn that resistance training is the most impactful use of their exercise time.

Duolingo was one of the pioneers in the gamification space. I started using it last year to improve my Chinese and French. For me, the app's most powerful feature is its streak count because:

1. I don't want to miss a day of lessons because I'll lose my streak.

2. At the same time, I have 1 or 2  banked ""streak freezes"" so I can keep my streak even if I miss a day (you need to earn or purchase the streak freezes).

This approach is great because it is process-oriented (e.g. do this habit) rather than outcome-oriented (e.g. lose weight), which has been shown scientifically to be better for long term adherence.

You don't any app to ""gamify"" a habit you want to add. Crossing off days on a calendar will work equally if not better (the more this reminder is in plain sight, the better). If you like crossing items off a to-do list, add the habit there (I love Asana and Notion for managing tasks).

It was a bit of hassle as I had to keep a dish of water next to the bed to wet the sensor electrodes to avoid confounding the results by getting up. No surprise, I abandoned that daily measurement (my Oura ring measures HRV effortlessly while I sleep, though strength training is not as central to my life as it was before).

In the fitness space, people get excited about how AI can analyze movement, but what I am most excited about is how to use AI to help people adopt healthier lifestyles--we generally know it's important to exercise, but doing it is challenging.

If Netflix and YouTube can recommend content you'll find interesting, how can a health app recommend a health practice that you'll adopt to improve your health long term?

The recommendation will likely need to account for and adapt to your preferences, personality, knowledge/skills, and life stage. It also must be the right level of difficulty: If it's too challenging, you'll get discouraged and give up. If it's too easy, you might not get much benefit or lose motivation.

Scientists and analysts are all experienced with using figures and tables to show data, but even the best don’t necessarily communicate their findings in a way that is easy to interpret and translate. As someone who appreciates good data visualization, these are the points I will think about when I want to communicate more effectively with data:

- The figure title should give the take-home message, not just the topic of the figure.

- Use colours and colour intensity to emphasize the most important lines/points.

- Annotate the figure so the reader can get the important context without reading the caption/text.

No; here’s why:
1. The main challenges in fitness relate to getting people to adopt resistance training and continue long term, not simply knowing what to do. A good trainer doesn’t just check form; they help people DO the things that are aligned with their motivations and abilities.

2. Even when computer vision becomes advanced enough to distinguish between subtle differences in exercise technique, differences in muscle activation patterns (which can make the difference between pain vs. no pain) cannot always be be seen, even by an expert coach. A good movement coach knows the right questions and cues to use for the individual in front of them.

What WILL happen is that these AI-based fitness products will:

- Allow more people to exercise smarter.

- Weed out low quality exercise professionals and force remaining ones to up their standards.

- Make it easier for exercisers and fitness professionals to make data-informed decisions through easier data tracking and visualization.

Lifting weights and resistance training are not just just for athletes or people who want to change their appearance; it helps to:

- Increase strength. That way, you can do everyday activities more easily with less pain/injury.
- Counteract muscle imbalances. Most sports and cardio activities (e.g. running, cycling, hiking) inherently train some muscles and not others. A good resistance training program systematically targets the various parts of the body to help you maintain good posture and reduce aches/pains.
- Counteract the effects of ageing: Falls, broken hips, frailty, and stooped posture should not be accepted as inevitable.

I will have 2 weeks starting Nov 24 to work on a final project that involves machine learning (a subset of artificial intelligence). More data = more accurate predictions.

The goal of this project is to create an algorithm that can tell you how much weight to lift for the prescribed number of reps, desired effort level (reps in reserve), and your attributes. Here's why:
1. The charts/formulas based %1RM have a lot of error; they are based on population averages and may not apply to you as an individual. Let's find an estimate that is more accurate for YOU.
2. We need a way to select an appropriate weight even without recent 1RM testing.

For simplicity, I am collecting data only on the barbell squat. Front squat, back squat, and zercher squats are included as long as the data provided are all for the same exercise. Here's my request:
1. Look at your training log and fill in the following Google form. My algorithm will require a rating of effort based on reps in reserved (RIR). If you don't track your reps in reserve, do it on your next squat session and come back! You can submit anonymously.
2. Share this with your lifting friends! The more data I have, the more accurate the predictions will be.

Rep max estimation equations exist, but usually have a lot of error for any given individual and/or circumstances. It would be amazing to have a machine learning model that can estimate YOUR rep max given YOUR previously-logged reps/sets, RPE/RIR, and even whether it's a regular training session or a session you've peaked for. 

My questions are:
 1. Does this type of app/algorithm already exist? I am pretty sure most just use the basic static equations.
 2. If not, I would LOVE to create this. The trouble would be getting enough data of training logs in order to sufficiently train and tune the model. Any ideas where I could go about getting adequate data for this purpose? 

I don't think looking at powerlifting/weightlifting competition results would the best data because:
 1. Most people don't train using maximal weight to failure most of the time (I envision a model that updates its estimations weekly). I want this algorithm to help people determine the right weight to use no matter what rep range, i.e. it should be able to estimate 1-15+ rep max.
 2. Repeated frequent data would be required so you won't have to do max testing for accurate rep max estimations.

I like the program you designed for me: it fits the tight time schedule I have, and I can always extend them when I have time (do 3 sets instead of 2).

Julie has made progress despite having little time to herself, being glued to her computer all day, and training with just a 12 kg kettlebell, 2x3kg dumbbells, and some bands. This is because:
- Exercise sessions take as little as 10 minutes per day.
- The exercises in her program provide high return-on-investment. 
- We constantly discuss how she can improve her sleep, nutrition, and recovery habits.

The deadlift with two bands is one such exercise in Julie’s program. It works many muscles, including muscles that help her improve her low back pain. All you need is 2 bands and an anchor (these are from Amazon).

There are several reasons why inverted rows (aka TRX rows, ring rows, suspension trainer rows, bodyweight rows) stand out:
👉Compared to some other row variations, it puts negligible strain on the low back--great if you have low back pain.
👉Great as part of minimalist, time-efficient home workouts or travel workouts as the equipment is inexpensive, easy to pack, and allows for endless exercise options for the entire body.
👉You can vary the difficulty even with only one piece of equipment.
👉The demands of the movement compliment the strength curve of the muscles, i.e. the movement is hardest at your strongest position and easiest at your weakest position so the muscles get trained uniformly along the entire range of motion. Contrast this with rows using a band, which become heavier as the band stretches and become hardest at your weakest position.
👉Helps improve posture, improve shoulder health, and strengthen the core.•

1,2022-01-12T00:35:00+0000,"Get Over the Fear: How to Do Your First Handstand Hold (video linked in the comments)

The wall-facing handstand is basically an advanced plank! It does emphasize shoulder stability more than the standard plank.

These are the benefits of handstands, even if you have a desk job:
• They train your core and glutes to support a healthy back.
• They help you maintain good posture: To do a handstand, you need adequate overhead mobility and thoracic mobility, which we don't tend to challenge enough in our day to day activities (use it or lose it!).
• They strengthen the muscles that help improve posture and keep your shoulders pain-free, such as the rotator cuff, serratus anterior, and lower trapezius. 

Steps:
1. Keep your abs tight as you walk your hands and feet up into the handstand position.
2. As you hold, push the floor away from to keep your shoulder muscles active.
3. Ensure good core stability by keeping your ribs pulled towards your spine. In other words, maintain a good hollow body position. The muscles of the butt and front of the thighs should also be tense, not just the upper body and core.
4. While the goal is to bring your hands as close to the wall as you can, start in a more horizontal position if needed and gradually work towards a more vertical position as you improve strength and stability.
Whatever position you choose, always push the floor away and keep your ribs pulled towards your spine.

The reality is that for most people who struggle with fitness on top of career, family, and social life, this type of mindset does not lead to long lasting health change.
 
Here's what will work for these people:
✔️Approaching health and exercise with incremental sustainable changes instead of going all-in or not bothering at all. If you're a type-A personality, I know this is hard!
✔️Instead thinking that a lack of ""motivation"" is what's stopping them, they take a small step that provides evidence they are capable of making the change. You don't need motivation for action; motivation can come AFTER action. It can literally be one squat. 
 
Working out at home is not fun (especially in a cold garage). I never feel ""motivated"" to train. But every day, I reluctantly start training by massaging my shoulder with the lacrosse ball before going onto the next exercise. I tell myself that I don't have to finish the prescribed sets and reps, as long as I get SOMETHING done (though I usually do). I don't train to ""transform"" my body, but to take care of it, to practice challenging skills, and to feel happy about the physical feats I can do. And while I'll never have a huge social media following, I hope I can be relatable to the average working adult who would otherwise not bother training their muscles.
 
Do you feel guilty about your health habits? Could you reframe the situation to help you feel good about what you're doing well, or to help you move closer to your goals?",10104327314119821_10103967587719411

8,2021-12-31T17:22:17+0000,"How to Make Progress with Home Workouts: 4 Push Up Exercise Variations

As you get better at push ups, eventually you'd need to do way too many reps to get a good training effect. I'm all about being time-efficient, so instead of doing endless reps of the standard push up, here are 4 push up progressions that will help you get stronger and gain muscle while saving time:
👉Decline push up
👉Banded decline push up
👉Deficit decline push up
👉Banded deficit decline push up
 
In addition to saving time, you'll be leveraging science and physics with these push up variations that you can do at home without equipment aside from stuff around the house!
✔️Elevating the feet shifts more of your bodyweight to your upper body.
✔️The band provides additional resistance, but even better is that it is an accommodating resistance. In other words, it adds more weight in the positions where you are stronger so you are challenged uniformly throughout the movement (otherwise, it gets very easy as you reach the top).
✔️Elevating the hands as shown allows you to descend lower relative to the hands. Using a greater motion enhances muscle growth.

Will you give any of these a try? Let me know how it goes!

14,2021-12-23T23:32:48+0000,"Why the scale goes crazy during the holidays: part 2/3.
 
It takes a surplus or deficit of ~3500 calories to gain or lose a pound of fat, which is more than what your average person consumes on an average day. Here are some explanations for large weight fluctuations that have nothing to do with true fat or muscle changes, but rather to do eating differently than normal during celebrations:
- Higher food residue in the digestive tract due to higher fibre intake.
- If you're constipated due to eating stuff you're not used to (like we did at the Indian buffet pictured), the food remaining in your gut will also add weight.
- Less time between the last meal and when you weigh yourself from late night eating.
 
What's the largest weight fluctuation you've experienced from one day to another, and why did that happen? I once did some targeted food, hydration, and salt manipulation to reduce my scale weight by 3 kg in 1 week for a lifting competition. It had nothing to do with fat loss.

Many people also find that training in a fitness facility provides them a greater sense of purpose than simply doing random exercise.

It takes a surplus or deficit of ~3500 calories to gain or lose a pound of fat, which is unlikely to happen from a day or two. When we eat much differently than usual (e.g. due to holiday festivities), here are some explanations for large weight fluctuations that have nothing to do with true fat or muscle changes:
- Water retention due to higher salt intake than normal.
- Muscles being fuller with glycogen and water, e.g. due to higher carbohydrate intake. For every gram of carbohydrate stored in the muscle (glycogen), we store 3-4 g of water.
 
I'm super grateful to be able to reconnect with with friends over food. In part 2, I'll cover some additional factors that make that scale weight spike up. Did anything in this post surprise you?",10104327314119821_10103960734697921
