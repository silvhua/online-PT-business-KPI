What you see:
✅ A girl who loves exercise - possibly even obsessed 
✅ A person who is motivated
✅ A physically strong female
✅ Someone who eats really well
✅ Not a big partier 
✅ Has time to train 6 times a week

What I see:
✅ A rock solid mindset 
✅ Someone who is disciplined 
✅ A physically and mentally strong female
✅ Someone who nourishes and fuels her body
✅ The most extrovert, social butterfly you’ll ever meet - but doesn’t prioritise partying
✅ Commits to training 6 times a week

Mindset - one of the most important elements to any health and fitness journey. Perspective changes based on the person - we all know the glass half empty/half full example.

If you’re eating well and doing physical exercise but not prioritising your mental exercise - I can promise you what you’re doing is not sustainable in the long term! 

Work on your mindset and the game changes…",62,1,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/327469337_920332829124995_2503783055957800771_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=nGZh0ymRgA8AX8TXpL9&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfBVp9vU7yL54VhTOXv1Cgc8to-8WZpdj5xUS_jMu37mLQ&oe=63D6D599,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn2g-nCBzCZ/,17902790093652450,"[{'timestamp': '2023-01-25T20:50:54+0000', 'text': 'SEND PIC ON👉 @_GYM_ROCKSTARS', 'username': 'khush_4992', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '17960166545493292'}]",,,

The best thing you can do for your body is track your own cycle. See the trends. See the variables. Become in tune with your body.

Creatine is one of the most vastly researched supplements and has been promoted in the fitness industry in the last few years. According to research, supplementation with creatine monohydrate has been shown to increase Skeletal muscle mass, lean body mass and muscle fibre size. Research also suggests past this and it may encourage healthy aging and benefit brain health. 

𝐃𝐨 𝐈 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐞?
Creatine supplementation can be hugely beneficial for athletic performance and studies have also showed it can have an impact on body composition (prolonged creatine ingestion inducing an increase in fat free mass). 

𝐃𝐨 𝐈 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐞?
Nope. 5g daily will suffice. (The idea to saturate the muscle is just to experience benefits sooner).
Increase water consumption when you start taking creatine.

Evidence does suggest post workout is superior to pre workout.

- Bloating - This is due to the muscles absorbing the water with the Creatine. Very common and usually subsides when the muscles are saturated.
- Stomach discomfort - May cause stomach sensitivity like bloating.

1. Being consistently good is better than being occasionally perfect.

2. The weekend makes up a large part of the week. If you think you’re being good during the week and not making progress - take a look at your weekends.

3. Sleep is one of the most underestimated tools to help you achieve ANY goal. If you’re sleep is shit and you’re sacrificing it ‘to seize the morning’ and train at 6am - you may be doing more harm than good.

4. Water consumption is the simplest way to becoming a healthier version of yourself. Stop looking at fad diets, detox teas, apple cider vinegar and look at your hydration status. Dehydration affects every system in our body and can lead to lack of energy, low mood, injury and brain fog (to mention afew).

5. Human connection, vitamin D and exercise are some of the most under utilised mental health prescriptions. Try increase all of these on the daily to see an instant mood shift 🙏

6. Stop trying to be a people pleaser and learn to say no - you are your own most important asset. 

7. Live every day like it’s your last ❤️ Do what makes you happy!

My clients are thriving 🙌

Why? 
 - Because I make it easy for them ✅

But how?
- Well instead of giving them 7 million tasks in week one. I have a much slower, more sustainable approach! I use healthy habits to help them adjust to a long term lifestyle change. 

❌It’s not pretty. 
❌It’s not fancy. 
❌It doesn’t sell well.

✅ But it works. You see if you commit to the long term, you can do it slower. If you’re only commiting to 6 weeks - you have to change immediately. But we all know nothing changes that quick. Nothing sustainable anyway. It takes time. It takes effort. But we’re here for the long term so who’s rushing? 🤷‍♀️

✅ My ethos is you only have ONE BODY - ONE PLACE to call home! You need to look after it. You need to mind and care for it.

Yay or Nay? 🧐

I put up a poll on my Instagram before Christmas to see who would be training over the holidays and 90% of you said you would. 

Sometimes, we have really high expectations of ourselves that when we don’t meet those expectations - we become disappointed 😔 While having high expectations is not necessarily a bad thing, being realistic is important 🙏

Going on holidays this Christmas I recognised that training was not going to be a priority to me. I said I’d train 2-3 times a week because I love it - not because I HAD to. 

There is NO NECESSITY for you to train during holidays. If you want to - do it! If you don’t - don’t! One thing I will say is 1. Do it for the right reasons - maybe that’s to get back into a routine, or for your mental health - but NOT to ‘burn off calories’

2. Whatever decision you make - own it! Don’t go winging and complaining after 3 weeks off that ‘you wish you did a bit’ or ‘how sore you are’. Get over it and get on with it.

14,2023-01-06T07:59:29+0000,"Struggle with protein 🧐

Here’s my TOP TIP - Build your meals around the protein source🙃

My first thought at any meal is what is the protein? And then I build my meal from there! 

People will blame time for their poor food choices but I can assure you, you don’t have to be super organised to make better choices! (The last 2 days I’ve been eating Turkey burgers, microwave rice and microwave cauliflower rice)

When I go shopping I like to have a rough guide done of what I’ll eat during the week so all the options are in my house - that way I’ve no excuses to eat out or make poor food choices! And if you do eat out, there’s NUMEROUS options to align with your goals!

15,2023-01-05T08:36:13+0000,"I think my CrossFit journey has been a little like your weight loss journey and here’s why 👂

I was asked to do my first CrossFit competition late 2018.

I first started to dabble in Crossfit in 2019. 

I would just do random workouts with random exercises and to be fair - it was enough to win competitions at a scaled level.

In 2020, I joined a CrossFit gym and this is where I say my journey began.

I can honestly say the most progress I’ve made was in the last 6 months of 2022. 

Let me tell you why? 

I started a programme that was tailored to my goals. A structured progressive overload programme that was in accordance with my goals.

Ok let me relate this back to your weight loss journey. 

My first year of CrossFit I was essentially pissing in the wind. Random workouts with no structure. But I still made progress. Does that relate to the start of your journey? You were doing it alone but you still lost weight because you made some small changes?

The next year and a half - I programme hopped - I think I did 3 different programmes in the space of 1.5 years with none of them aligning with my goals. Although the process of programme hopping in itself is the problem - not sticking with something long enough to see the results 🫣

The last 6 months I feel like Goldilocks, I’ve got it just right. This programme is geared towards my goals. It allows for progression and I’ve reaped the rewards!

You see this could be you. 

Maybe you’ve had the same journey as me?

Maybe you’ve tried it alone?

You’ve tried many diets or coaches or programmes that didn’t work?

But take it from me - when you find the right one - you’ll never look back 💪",61,8,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/323367005_489444910036524_8236448764833263749_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=mZr86qCkWwwAX_m5rz-&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfA5wtj4BEr7EzUNRKCnYOdoXittgEtvsHmmB2i7Vo4csw&oe=63D67E78,https://www.instagram.com/p/CnBul-6IP15/,17942300240367983,"[{'timestamp': '2023-01-05T09:19:22+0000', 'text': '🤩\U0001faf6🏼', 'username': 'niamhhod', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2023-01-05T09:27:42+0000', 'text': '@niamhhod 😘', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 0, 'id': '17986574737743079'}]}, 'id': '17854008641859784'}, {'timestamp': '2023-01-05T08:50:39+0000', 'text': 'What a beast 👏', 'username': 'tori_tucka', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2023-01-05T09:02:36+0000', 'text': '@tori_tucka always the best cheerleader ❤️', 'username': 'coach_mcloone', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '17970413375011827'}]}, 'id': '17961555584230941'}, {'timestamp': '2023-01-05T08:49:14+0000', 'text': 'Wow.....your body is unreal fit...you look amazing...🥰', 'username': 'karentrayers', 'like_count': 1, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2023-01-05T09:03:15+0000', 'text': '@karentrayers ah thank you Karen!

21,2022-12-30T09:36:53+0000,"Yesterday I told you about time being a problem for women trying to change their body shape. They feel they can't give full commitment to a programme because they are too busy. 

They feel they have no time to go to the gym because they are too busy. Or they don’t have time to be making seperate dinners for their family.

Thankfully a lot of my clients train from home 3 times a week with minimal equipment. And I NEVER ask them to make seperate dinners.

You see the thing is - you don't actually need hours in the gym to achieve your goals - especially if you're crazy busy. I also encourage women to make better, more simple choices if they are too busy to cook. And instead of scrolling on Social media - I set step targets for them (even if they scroll while they walk). 

You see - it's pretty simple. Try this out and let me know how it goes.

We all lead such busy lifestyles these days. We give time to our families, our friends, and work and we are left with little to no time. 

It's so frustrating because you're trying to be a good friend, mother, daughter, sister, colleague, or employee. But what's left for you? Or maybe there is time? 

I've found that most people usually can find time. Maybe instead of an hour of Netflix we could swap it for a workout? Maybe instead of scrolling we could be walking? Or instead of picking up a takeaway on the way home from work, we could pick up a ready meal in a supermarket? The problem lies in trying to do too much.

To be totally honest, I love both pictures. I’m proud of my body in both pictures. 🙏 

These pictures respresent 2 points in time. The one on the left I was socialising a lot more while the one on the right was sacrificing a lot more. 

Both pictures, I trained. Both pictures I ate well and slept lots. 

The two main differences are: 
1. A lot more structured training programme 
2. A lot less social events 

Some times I’ll be leaner. Other times I’ll retain a little more water. But honestly, I don’t train for aesthetics - I train and eat well for how my body feels. When I train hard and eat nutritiously - my body is energised and thanks me 🙏 i want every woman to feel good no matter what they’re body fat percentage or scale weight shows ❤️

1,2022-12-27T09:57:06+0000,"Yesterday, I mentioned a common problem i see in women trying to drop body fat.

Women lack education and understanding around nutrition which causes serial yo yo dieting. 

To fix this problem, you need more nutrition education on how you can eat the foods you love and still get the results you deserve. 

Here's how it works: 

As a qualified nutritionist, I educate females on how to make good food choices to achieve their goals. I don't focus on short term quick fixes but long term sustainable results. I genuinely believe if you hand someone a diet plan you will only help them so far,  but if you educate them on a balanced lifestyle - this is invaluable.

Are you constantly fad dieting because you're afraid if you're not dieting you will gain weight. You're afraid that if you don't stick to that deficit you'll never be happy in your clothes. 

I feel terrible for you, because you're genuinely trying. You know no different. We've grown up with fad dieting, our mothers  yo yo dieted. It's all we've known - we only know strict calorie deficits and exercise to burn calories 😢 

But I've found the solution to your problems. I believe in education. Have you ever heard the saying “If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.” I want you to understand you CAN ACHIEVE results and ENJOY the food you love 😍

Let me tell you as with EVERYTHING in life - there are pros and cons to everything. 

What I am doing now is LITERALLY my dream job ❤️🔥 And I wouldn’t change it for the world. But nothing good in life comes without sacrifice.

While most people take a trip home and enjoy a month off. I will be working. (I’ll take the holidays off) But my job doesn’t stop ✋ 

Goals require sacrifice. Achievements require sacrifice. Nothing is handed to anyone.

The same goes for fat loss or weight loss.

Effort determines the result! 

So next time you think - someone is ‘so lucky’ - think of what they did to achieve that.

Fitness is not just fitness.

Eating healthy food is not just nourishing your body.

The Strong and Sassy programme is continuing to CHANGES LIVES ❤️🔥

You may THINK you just need a gym.

You may THINK you just need a diet plan.

What you really need is support and accountability 🙏

Emily started this programme with her confidence levels at an all time low. She wasn’t happy in how she looked or felt 🥹

Now 9 months later -
✅ She has completed true grit
✅ Lost 13.5kg
✅ Become the STRONGEST version of herself
✅ Gained confidence
✅ Is now pregnant again ❤️ (and still trusting me) 

If you’re a post partum mum wanting to feel good again, wanting to regain your energy, wanting to become the strongest and most confident version of yourself - this is the programme for you!

17,2022-12-06T18:51:18+0000,"Christmas is well and truely on its way. While this is an exciting time and a time where people are socialising more and enjoying themselves more. I’ve actually found it can be a hugely anxious time for people too.🥹

I’ve witnessed women who are hugely self conscious and unhappy in their body struggle to pick an outfit for a Christmas dinner.

I’ve seen women change about 10 times before throwing on the baggiest option they can find.

Up until this year - that was Teresa. Teresa hid behind bigger clothes in an effort to feel better.

I remember once upon a time - myself - holding onto clothes ‘that would fit again’.

Ladies this has to stop 🛑 

I am telling you now - it’s not about weight loss. It’s not about a clothes size. It’s not about number on the weighing scales.

It’s about feeling good internally.

It’s about having a balanced lifestyle. Nourishing your body but never feeling guilty about food. It’s about exercising because you enjoy it. Not using it as punishment. ❌

Until you can find that internal happiness - it doesn’t matter what diet you’re doing, what calories you’re eating, what exercise you’re doing - you won’t be comfortable and confident.

But the good news is - I have the solution🙋‍♀️

My Strong and Sassy programme was designed specifically to help women become the healthiest, happiest and most confident versions of themselves.

1. Nutrition is the most important element to these goals - are you eating enough protein? Are you eating healthy but not tracking calories? Are you blowing calories mindlessly at weekends? All questions that you should ask yourself when having a goal!

2. Random classes = random results. Follow a progressive overload programme and watch the results flow in

3. One of the most underrated performance tools - sleep! Stop neglecting it - start treating it as important as nutrition and even MORE important than exercise!

To say I’m proud would be an understatement here and be prepared for a long post 😂

Going into my first individual event my expectations were to keep within the Top 6. So winning this event was truely special 🥰

With 3 event wins, I can honestly say my proudest moment was 3rd in the last event 😂 I went to one of the darkest places I’ve ever been in my training and I would not have got through it without my ultimate cheer squad @lillie704 @lift__with__laura @misssophieelizabeth @col_ryaner @renners9 @o_boyce 

I feel so thankful and grateful to be ABLE to push my body to these limits and how fun is it doing it with the best crew. Even more special was podiuming with @brian_fannon 🙌🙏

As always with every competition, there’s things to learn and FUCK these girls are STRONG 💪 So there’s still lots to be done 🙏

Thank you to @battleofbenton for an incredible event. Ran impeccably from start to finish. 

And the biggest thank you to @jaydenazza @crossfitbotany who had me in this condition going into this competition. The future is looking bright 💃

That’s it for the competitions for 2022 (never again will I do 3 in a row 😂).
