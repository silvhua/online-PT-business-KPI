What do you think? Would you use this?

Personally, I prefer lifting heavy weights and learning gymnastics skills, but I can see this being great for a lot of people who prefer home-based training. Exercise classes that guide you on good habits and customization are even better.

There's no surprise that interest in wearable tech is rising. My questions is how much the increasing interest in fitness trackers is from people who are already exercising regularly, people who end up increasing their physical activity/health practices as a result of the device, or people with aspirations of improving fitness but remain sedentary.

As a fitness professional, I'm happy to see that interest in strength training is increasing!

8,2023-01-03T20:40:58+0000,"Gamify your goals

Duolingo was one of the pioneers in the gamification space. I started using it last year to improve my Chinese and French. For me, the app's most powerful feature is its streak count because:

1. I don't want to miss a day of lessons because I'll lose my streak.

2. At the same time, I have 1 or 2  banked ""streak freezes"" so I can keep my streak even if I miss a day (you need to earn or purchase the streak freezes).

This approach is great because it is process-oriented (e.g. do this habit) rather than outcome-oriented (e.g. lose weight), which has been shown scientifically to be better for long term adherence.

You don't any app to ""gamify"" a habit you want to add. Crossing off days on a calendar will work equally if not better (the more this reminder is in plain sight, the better). If you like crossing items off a to-do list, add the habit there (I love Asana and Notion for managing tasks).

What gamification strategies do you have?

I just lost my 170+ day Duolingo streak because I missed my lesson on New Year's Eve of all days. I guess the new year really IS a fresh start for me.

In the fitness space, people get excited about how AI can analyze movement, but what I am most excited about is how to use AI to help people adopt healthier lifestyles--we generally know it's important to exercise, but doing it is challenging.

If Netflix and YouTube can recommend content you'll find interesting, how can a health app recommend a health practice that you'll adopt to improve your health long term?

The recommendation will likely need to account for and adapt to your preferences, personality, knowledge/skills, and life stage. It also must be the right level of difficulty: If it's too challenging, you'll get discouraged and give up. If it's too easy, you might not get much benefit or lose motivation.

No; here‚Äôs why:
1. The main challenges in fitness relate to getting people to adopt resistance training and continue long term, not simply knowing what to do. A good trainer doesn‚Äôt just check form; they help people DO the things that are aligned with their motivations and abilities.

2. Even when computer vision becomes advanced enough to distinguish between subtle differences in exercise technique, differences in muscle activation patterns (which can make the difference between pain vs. no pain) cannot always be be seen, even by an expert coach. A good movement coach knows the right questions and cues to use for the individual in front of them.

What WILL happen is that these AI-based fitness products will:

- Allow more people to exercise smarter.

- Weed out low quality exercise professionals and force remaining ones to up their standards.

- Make it easier for exercisers and fitness professionals to make data-informed decisions through easier data tracking and visualization.

Lifting weights and resistance training are not just just for athletes or people who want to change their appearance; it helps to:

- Increase strength. That way, you can do everyday activities more easily with less pain/injury.
- Counteract muscle imbalances. Most sports and cardio activities (e.g. running, cycling, hiking) inherently train some muscles and not others. A good resistance training program systematically targets the various parts of the body to help you maintain good posture and reduce aches/pains.
- It counteracts the effects of ageing: Falls, broken hips, frailty, and stooped posture should not be accepted as inevitable.

19,2022-09-18T21:07:28+0000,"There‚Äôs an abundance of free training resources out there, so why bother paying for it? 

The way I see it, my role is to apply my years of specialized education and experience to save people the guess work so they can just do the best bang-for-buck workouts AND still have time for other things. Online training can never replace in-person coaching, but I strive to provide the same professional guidance online as I do in person. That‚Äôs why I started making exercise videos. 

Julie* represents the type of client I most want to help: She has a high-stress career AND has 3 kids including a toddler. ‚ÄúI feel stronger, and more confident taking care of my baby daughter. I like the program you designed for me: it fits the tight time schedule I have, and I can always extend them when I have time (do 3 sets instead of 2). As the program stands now, I don't feel too pressured for time, and thus less stressed.‚Äù

Julie has made progress despite having little time to herself, being glued to her computer all day, and training with just a 12 kg kettlebell, 2x3kg dumbbells, and some bands. This is because:
- Exercise sessions take as little as 10 minutes per day.
- The exercises in her program provide high return-on-investment. 
- We constantly discuss how she can improve her sleep, nutrition, and recovery habits.

The deadlift with two bands is one such exercise in Julie‚Äôs program. It works many muscles, including muscles that help her improve her low back pain. All you need is 2 bands and an anchor (these are from Amazon).

24,2022-01-12T00:30:06+0000,"Get Over the Fear: How to Do Your First Handstand Hold
¬†
The wall-facing handstand is basically an advanced plank! It does emphasize shoulder stability more than the standard plank.
¬†
These are the benefits of handstands, even if you have a desk job:
‚Ä¢ They train your core and glutes to support a healthy back.
‚Ä¢ They help you maintain good posture: To do a handstand, you need adequate overhead mobility and thoracic mobility, which we don't tend to challenge enough in our day to day activities (use it or lose it!).
‚Ä¢ They strengthen the muscles that help improve posture and keep your shoulders pain-free, such as the rotator cuff, serratus anterior, and lower trapezius.
¬†
Steps:
1. Keep your abs tight as you walk your hands and feet up into the handstand position.
2. As you hold, push the floor away from to keep your shoulder muscles active.
3. Ensure good core stability by keeping your ribs pulled towards your spine. In other words, maintain a good hollow body position. The muscles of the butt and front of the thighs should also be tense, not just the upper body and core.
4. While the goal is to bring your hands as close to the wall as you can, start in a more horizontal position if needed and gradually work towards a more vertical position as you improve strength and stability.
Whatever position you choose, always push the floor away and keep your ribs pulled towards your spine.

0,2022-01-01T04:55:04+0000,"It's a new year. The time when the fitness industry likes to guilt you into buying their products and services. Or get you ""motivated"" to make a grand transformation by crushing yourself.
¬†
The reality is that for most people who struggle with fitness on top of career, family, and social life, this type of mindset does not lead to long lasting health change.
¬†
Here's what will work for these people:
‚úîÔ∏èApproaching health and exercise with incremental sustainable changes instead of going all-in or not bothering at all. If you're a type-A personality, I know this is hard!
‚úîÔ∏èInstead thinking that a lack of ""motivation"" is what's stopping them, they take a small step that provides evidence they are capable of making the change. You don't need motivation for action; motivation can come AFTER action. It can literally be one squat. 
¬†
Working out at home is not fun (especially in a cold garage). I never feel ""motivated"" to train. But every day, I reluctantly start training by massaging my shoulder with the lacrosse ball before going onto the next exercise. I tell myself that I don't have to finish the prescribed sets and reps (though I usually do), as long as I get SOMETHING done. I don't train to ""transform"" my body, but to take care of it, to practice challenging skills, and to feel happy about the physical feats I can do.¬†And while I'll never have a huge social media following, I hope I can be relatable to the average working adult who would otherwise not bother training their muscles.

2,2021-12-31T17:20:53+0000,"How to Make Progress with Home Workouts: 4 Push Up Exercise Variations

As you get better at push ups, eventually you'd need to do way too many reps to get a good training effect. I'm all about being time-efficient, so instead of doing endless reps of the standard push up, here are 4 push up progressions that will help you get stronger and gain muscle while saving time:
üëâDecline push up
üëâBanded decline push up
üëâDeficit decline push up
üëâBanded deficit decline push up
¬†
In addition to saving time, you'll be leveraging science and physics with these push up variations that you can do at home without equipment aside from stuff around the house!
‚úîÔ∏èElevating the feet shifts more of your bodyweight to your upper body.
‚úîÔ∏èThe band provides additional resistance, but even better is that it is an accommodating resistance. In other words, it adds more weight in the positions where you are stronger so you are challenged uniformly throughout the movement (otherwise, it gets very easy as you reach the top).
‚úîÔ∏èElevating the hands as shown allows you to descend lower relative to the hands. Using a greater motion enhances muscle growth.

Will you give any of these a try? Let me know how it goes!

¬†
Aside from holiday noms, some other things that increase scale weight that aren't due to fat gain include:
- Water retention during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (i.e. the days before the period starts).
- Water retention due to stress. If you're a little less stressed now, you may even find the scale goes down!
- Water retention from certain medications.

This year has been my best year yet as stress has been at an all-time low, which has helped my body get objectively healthier (as confirmed with lab tests) despite no longer sticking with ""clean"" eating and putting on body fat.

¬†
It takes a surplus or deficit of ~3500 calories to gain or lose a pound of fat, which is more than what your average person consumes on an average day. Here are some explanations for large weight fluctuations that have nothing to do with true fat or muscle changes, but rather to do eating differently than normal during celebrations:
- Higher food residue in the digestive tract due to higher fibre intake.
- If you're constipated due to eating stuff you're not used to (like we did at the Indian buffet pictured), the food remaining in your gut will also add weight.
- Less time between the last meal and when you weigh yourself from late night eating.
¬†
What's the largest weight fluctuation you've experienced from one day to another, and why did that happen? I once did some targeted food, hydration, and salt manipulation to reduce my scale weight by 3 kg in 1 week for a lifting competition. It had nothing to do with fat loss.

Do you get emotional (or simply curious) about the number on the scale fluctuating a couple (or more) pounds day to day?
¬†
It takes a surplus or deficit of ~3500 calories to gain or lose a pound of fat, which is unlikely to happen from a day or two. When we eat much differently than usual (e.g. due to holiday festivities), here are some explanations for large weight fluctuations that have nothing to do with true fat or muscle changes:
- Water retention due to higher salt intake than normal.
- Muscles being fuller with glycogen and water, e.g. due to higher carbohydrate intake. For every gram of carbohydrate stored in the muscle (glycogen), we store 3-4 g of water.

I was able to snatch and clean and jerk pretty much on my first day of trying (it looked ugly, but still counted). I was able ride a bike after 7 days of practice. I can play hit the badminton birdie although the instructor disapproves of my technique. Figuring out how to balance on my hands is a whole new beast. There have been highs and lows and this experience is making me better at coaching others.

¬†
Stretching and mobility exercises can help, but ultimately, having well-functioning postural muscles is what will hold you up in the proper position. So if you're strapped for time, why not kill two birds with one stone: Get stronger AND improve posture/mobility.
¬†
¬†In this hands-on workshop I'll be presenting tomorrow for @scwist.canada , busy professionals will learn what to prioritize in their exercise routine to improve posture and reduce pain. You will also gain practical strategies on how to include strength training in your life, even if it is just one minute at a time.
¬†
‚Ä¢ Have confidence to exercise regularly.
‚Ä¢ Get stronger so you can perform better in your everyday life.
‚Ä¢ Know how to keep your body feeling good without medication.
‚Ä¢ Be able to work without the distraction of pain.
Come prepared to use your brain and work those muscles!

I've made progress on many things by spending 60 sec or less on one specific thing on a daily basis, including posture, pain, and strength (pull ups and push ups).

I tell clients that they don't need a big block of time to exercise; even one set of one exercise will create results.

Going to apply this now to my handstand practice. It literally takes 30 seconds or less depending on when I tumble over.

¬†
This type of course is extremely important, but a few things frustrated me about how back safety was framed in this course:
1. It gave the impression that tasks are dangerous and that the back is fragile.
2. There was NO discussion whatsoever about how strengthening the back muscles is protective of back injury.
¬†
I don't blame the school. They were communicating the same information that is given by WorkSafeBC and other authorities.
¬†
I messaged the instructor to invite further discussion about these frustrations. Unfortunately, the discussion did not go beyond her replying that she'd read the link I sent later on. I gave her my email but I have never heard back and I have no way of communicating with her now that the course is done.
¬†
I decided to present on back health at @safecarebc‚Äôs Hearts and Hands Conference that's happening next week. I'm hoping to shake up how we talk about back health and help empower more people through principles of strength training and resistance exercise.

¬†
I will be doing a presentation titled ""You Must Use Your Back! Just Bulletproof it first"", which aims to teach healthcare workers how to strengthen the back safely and stay safe when maneuvering patients.
¬†
I am a kinesiologist with over 4 years of experience helping healthcare workers return to work after injury. I realized that many injuries were due to poor strength and body mechanics, so now do personal training to help people get stronger.
¬†
In my workshop, healthcare assistants who have back pain or who want to avoid back injury will learn:

9,2021-10-01T03:54:16+0000,"Having a well functioning core is important for low back health and since the core stabilizes your lumbar spine and helps with posture. And of course, if training the 6 pack helps you feel confident at the beach, that doesn't hurt either.
¬†
Unfortunately, conventional crunches and sit ups put pressure on the lumbar discs, which can be problematic for those with discogenic back pain. Even worse is that they often train the hip flexors more than the abdominals, which means¬†you're wasting time.
¬†
The McGill curl up was created by the world's top scientist on low back pain, Dr Stuart McGill. Based on his lab research, this is the smarter way to train the core, particularly the rectus abdominus (6 pack muscles).

@squat_university recommends starting with sets of 5 reps with 10 sec holds to enhance spine stability. 
¬†
If you primarily want to BUILD the 6 pack muscles for aesthetics and not just improve core stability, it seems that isotonic exercises rather than isometrics (e.g. movement-based vs. holds) are better. In that case, consider doing the curl ups for as many reps as you can to really feel a burn in the abs. Take a short rest and repeat for several sets--rest interval should be equal or shorter than work interval. An example can be to do as many controlled reps as possible for 30 sec, rest 20 sec, then repeat for 3-5 rounds. You want to feel as much burn as possible to enhance muscle growth. However, keep in mind that no matter how much you train the abs, having a 6 pack requires your abdominal fat to be low enough for the ab lines to show.

Do you enjoy training the core? Why or why not? Personally, I don't enjoy exercises where I don't feel like I am accomplishing anything, which is why I prefer lifting weights, handstands, and pull ups!

10,2021-09-28T20:54:59+0000,"High protein low calorie pumpkin cheesecake! This recipe is inspired by the pumpkin pie basque burnt cheesecake I got from @mardyskitchen last year--it was divine.
¬†
This version can be whipped up quickly and can be easily enjoyed on a day to day basis as the portion shown is only 144 calories with 19.5 g of protein (4 g carbs, 4.8g fat) based on using 3 eggs (it will be lower if you use 2 eggs) and using a zero-calorie sweetener (I used @servesweetie Serve granular).
¬†
This recipe is forgiving in that you can deviate in the quantities and it will still turn out well. Using more eggs will result in a richer flavour. Baking in a water bath will give it a much smoother texture and will make it less likely to dry out from over-baking.

Edit: 
Some of the text got cut off, so to clarify, it‚Äôs 100 g of pumpkin pur√©e and 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.

11,2021-09-24T19:46:13+0000,"Today I attended a panel discussion by @scwist.canada on barriers for women in STEM careers. As a kinesiologist, my mission is to promote strength training. Unfortunately, cultural attitudes and beliefs about strength training have stopped a lot of women from strength training. This is particularly true in non-Western cultures, where lifting weights is considered for men or bodybuilders only.
¬†
I'm participating in ‚ÄúI Move for Immigrant Women in Science‚Äù, an initiative by the @IWS_Network. In line with my passion for promoting strength training, I suggest that next time you go for a walk, consider doing a few lunges--even 2 lunges will be good to start. You'll not only still enjoy the benefits of being outside, but also strengthen your bones and muscles to keep your back and knees healthy. Swipe for technique tips!
¬†
Personally, my mom calls me a man because I lift heavy weights, whereas my dad has not made any such comments and has even built me a platform so I can do Olympic lifting in my garage.

12,2021-09-22T18:41:14+0000,"Pull ups with bands are NOT the best way to get your first pull up.
¬†
Being able to get your first pull up is a great goal, but getting from zero to 1 pull up is not intuitive. Today I (somewhat) hit a personal record in the pull up--6 reps. Notice that I got the chin over the bar on the first few reps, but on the 6th, I struggled hard and was not able to pull up as high.
¬†
I have never used bands or the assisted pull up machine for my pull up training and have continued to make progress. So why not use bands? Bands provide a ton of assistance at the bottom position but provide almost no assistance as you reach the top, which is the hardest part of the movement.
¬†
Here's a better way to work towards a full pull up: Start with just eccentric (aka ""negative"") chin ups (pull up with underhand grip). Climb up and start with the bar at the chest, then lower down slowly until you reach a full hang. To train towards your first pull up, aim to increase the duration of each lower to 30 seconds. At that point, you'll likely be able to get your first chin up.
¬†
If you do this right, you'll feel your abs burn--it's actually better for activating the abs than most ab exercises. 

Are you working towards your first pull up, or improving your pull-ups?

In my experience, it's Bulgarian split squats.

I'm undecided about whether Bulgarian split squats or single leg Romanian deadlifts are worse.

Which exercise do you despise the most but still do because it's good for you (or because your coach tells you to)?

¬†
No amount of activity can counteract the effects of being sedentary for 8 hours. Ideally, you would avoid being in a static position for more than 20 minutes at a time. So what if you have to work at a desk all day? Here's an exercise you can do right at your desk, not only to avoid being static for too long, but to actually improve your posture and shoulder health. All you need is about 30 seconds.
¬†
This is a great exercise to train the lower trapezius and serratus anterior, which are both involved in upward rotation of the scapula--super important if you want to maintain overhead mobility of the shoulders, avoid shoulder pain, and have good upper body strength (especially for overhead movements).
¬†
The science:
üëâCreating external rotation torque by pushing against the band will decrease subscapularis involvement while activating the teres minor and infraspinatus.
üëâPulling the elbows into the body will decrease posterior deltoid involvement.
üëâDepressing the shoulders will decrease upper trap involvement.
¬†
If you do this as part of your workday, perform 5-12 quality repetitions up to 5 times throughout day, approximately every 30-120 minutes--the quality of each rep is more important than how many you do. Perhaps anchor it to another daily event, such as when checking email, waiting for a meeting to start, or going to the bathroom. 

Of course, this is also a great exercise to do outside of work to keep your shoulders healthy. You can include it as part of a warm up before resistance training or while resting between heavier exercises.

¬†
There are several reasons why inverted rows (aka TRX rows, ring rows, suspension trainer rows, bodyweight rows) stand out:
¬†
üëâCompared to some other row variations, it puts negligible strain on the low back--great if you have low back pain.
üëâGreat as part of minimalist, time-efficient home workouts or travel workouts as the equipment is inexpensive, easy to pack, and allows for endless exercise options for the entire body.
üëâYou can vary the difficulty even with only one piece of equipment.
üëâThe demands of the movement compliment the strength curve of the muscles, i.e. the movement is hardest at your strongest position and easiest at your weakest position so the muscles get trained uniformly along the entire range of motion. Contrast this with rows using a band, which become heavier as the band stretches and become hardest at your weakest position.
üëâHelps improve posture, improve shoulder health, and strengthen the core.‚Ä¢

Progress in training can mean using more weight or doing more reps. But some wins are harder to quantify, such as form. Had a small win today: After more than a year since my previous attempt at handstand push ups during my challenge with my Equinox coworkers (shout out to @johnstuartgreen !), today I made a bit of progress by being able to get more range of motion (head moved slightly diagonally instead of just down) and still be able to get back up.
¬†
Still a long ways to go for a full good rep, but it's nice to confirm that my training is resulting in some strength gains.

Getting bodywork done by a therapist or masseuse is great to keep your body feeling good, but most of us don't have the time or money to get it done weekly, if at all.
¬†
Sitting or slouching means the thoracic spine (between the neck and low back) gets stuck in this hunched position, which can cause the back, neck, and shoulders to not feel great. Here's a no-equipment way to mobilize the thoracic spine.
¬†
When reaching the elbow to the ceiling, use the other arm to push to assist with increasing rotation. When you reach the end, inhale, then exhale and push further into rotation.
When reaching the elbow under the armpit, try to get the elbow to get as close to the floor as possible. The supporting arm should continue to push the floor throughout.

3,2021-07-14T20:01:14+0000,"Home/Office Functional Training: Core Training without Crunches!
¬†
Did you know that push ups are a core exercise when done properly? That's because the abs have to work to keep your low back from sagging down. In the elevated single arm push up, you will also train another SUPER important function of the core: the ability to resist rotation.
¬†
1. Stand close to a wall or elevated surface with a wide stance. 
2. Place hand below chest height or lower (lower will be harder).
3. Go onto your tip toes. 
4. Lower the body until shoulders pass the wall, then push back up. 
¬†
Tips:
- Keep the muscles in the abs, glutes, and even the front of the legs tight to keep the body in a stable straight line from head to toe, which allows your body to express its full strength.
- Forearm should remain approximately horizontal. Adjust hand and/or feet position if needed to achieve this.
- Don't let the body rotate. Widen the stance to make this easier.

¬†
This apple protein cheesecake recipe has 108 calories, 16 g protein, 5 g carbs, and 2 g fat per serving (assuming you use @lakanto or other zero calorie sweetener and 1% dry curd cottage cheese) and makes 4 servings.
¬†
Bake at a low temperature because if it bubbles a lot while baking, the texture won't be as smooth. Bake until no longer liquid but still jiggly: just done, but not too long so it stays soft and moist. In my @cuisinart airfryer toaster oven, it took about 30 min at 250 deg F, but baking time will depend on your oven and baking dish.

What do the abs do, anyway? Believe it or not, sit ups and crunches don't actually replicate what the abs do in the majority of our daily tasks. Most of the time, the core muscles work to stabilize the spine. In the case of planks and ab wheel roll outs (or swing roll outs!), the abs prevent the back from arching to protect the back. Notice how the low back is flat throughout the movement.‚Ä¢

¬†
If you're busy, it makes sense to do the exercises that give you the most bang-for-your-buck. The suitcase deadlift is one such exercise:¬†
- Core muscles work to keep the body symmetrical while holding weight on one side.
- Glutes and legs work to lift the weight.
- Back muscles work to protect the spine.
- Super practical for everyday life!
¬†
This exercise can be performed using any weighted object such as a kettlebell or a literal suitcase. The landmine variation shown here is great if you have minimal equipment like my messy garage gym.

17,2021-06-14T22:57:52+0000,"Is it truly heavy, or does it just FEEL heavy?
¬†
My dad's been a champ. I train him in person briefly every few weeks but he mostly trains on his own following the simple program I created for him on the online training app (his preferred workout time is 10pm!). After checking his form using the usual weight he uses, I said it was time to switch to the heaviest band. He didn't think he could do it, but I told him he could, even for 1 rep. He managed to get 2 sets of 10 and 12 reps with the heaviest band!
¬†
If you are worried about getting hurt and haven't received much coaching from a trainer, it's likely you're underestimating your strength. In my experience training hundreds of people, people can double or triple the weight they're using for lower body movements like goblet squats and deadlifts.
¬†
Today I did squats, and I knew I was pushing my limit because there was a point when I almost stopped moving, not simply because it ""felt"" hard. My first trainer, @lift4love23, taught me how to push beyond what I was capable of and as a result, I saw some rapid progress that time.
¬†
Erring on the side of caution is a good idea when you're training on your own, but even just a bit of feedback from a trainer can ensure you're not missing out on potential strength gains.

18,2021-06-11T00:17:16+0000,"Do you ever feel pinching or pain in your shoulders, particularly when reaching overhead?
¬†
With our modern world of sitting, computer work, and stress, our shoulders can suffer. 
¬†
Even though the anatomy text books list the function of the serratus anterior as simply protraction, we can get better activation of this muscle by reducing involvement of other muscles which may take over to compensate:
1. Positioning the arms above shoulder height will reduce anterior deltoid involvement.
2. Creating external rotation torque will reduce pectoralis and subscapularis involvement.
3. Depressing the shoulders will decrease upper trap involvement.
¬†
If you're doing other exercises like push ups or planks, you can incorporate these strategies to better train the serratus anterior.
¬†
Here's a serratus anterior exercise that incorporates these strategies:
1. Get on all fours to get into the start position.
2. Position the hands a few inches in front of the shoulders.
¬†3. Sink your chest into the floor to retract the shoulder blades (this will cause the back to arch). This is the start position.
¬†4. Push the floor away from you as hard as you can (this will cause the upper back and shoulders to round). As you do so, imagine screwing the hands outwards, as if trying to turn the right hand clockwise and the left hand counter clockwise. Even though the hands won't move due to the friction of the floor, this will activate the serratus anterior muscles more.
¬†5. Release and return to the start position. Keep the shoulders far from your ears--do not allow the shoulders to shrug as you push.

¬†
I am a personal trainer, yet I still have my own personal trainer, @coachjure the ""No BS Strength Coach"" (true to name). I believe one of the most impactful things you can do for your health and fitness is to invest in professional guidance, whether that be long term or just for a few weeks to get you started on the right path.
¬†
It warms my heart to get positive feedback from my clients. But to be honest, my style of coaching does not suit everyone. As much as I wish I could be, I will never be the fun trainer who will make you laugh like @matty__porter or @robertnels, or have the perfect waist to hip ratio like @iris.salihagic, and that weakness is precisely what makes me much better at coaching clients online. The clients who appreciate my style the most are the ones who do the work simply with a bit of guidance and who value strength and proper form, not simply having fun or crushing ""workouts"". They appreciate the careful planning I put into their custom programs and the detailed feedback I give when they send me videos of them doing an exercise.
¬†
Hiring a trainer/coach is a big investment, so to get the most out of the experience, you need to think about what you want/need and communicate that clearly. At the same time, be aware that the role of a good coach is to challenge you and show you what you need‚Äîeven if it's not what you want. In my case, @coachjure very bluntly told me I was using too little weight on hip thrusts, and 3 days ago I discovered that I was able to add at least 20 kg more--from 45 to 65 kg for 12 reps. My glutes are still recovering.
¬†
What do YOU need to stay engaged with your fitness? Is it to be social while exercising? Is it to feel sweaty? Is it to feel a sense of achievement?

¬†
The lunge is an important fundamental movement pattern. Starting it from the kneeling position is not only a great starting point to learn it, but also a great way to assess your movement quality.
¬†
Start in a half kneeling position:
- Back thigh and torso completely vertical.
- Toes of back foot tucked so they contact the floor.
- Front leg bent 90 degrees at the knee with shin completely vertical and foot flat on the floor.
Stand up so that both knees are straight.
Lower back down to the start position and repeat.

¬†
This exercise is harder than it looks. Give it a try and let me know how it goes!
¬†
Benefits of this exercise:
- Train the pull up movement from home without a pull up bar.
- Core stability.
- Shoulder stability of the supporting arm.
¬†
Technique tips:
- Keep the spine neutral so that core is engaged; don't let the belly sag down.
- Push the floor away with the supporting arm to keep the shoulder in a strong position.
- Keep the rest of the body motionless as you pull the moving arm. Get the core to work!
- Move the shoulder through its full range of motion. When the arm is straight in the forward position, allow the shoulder come towards the ears. When you initiate the pull, pull the shoulder blade away from the ear, then pull the elbow to your side.

¬†
Here's a test of not only balance, but how well your GLUTEUS MEDIUS muscles function. These muscles function to keep your pelvis level any time you stand on one leg, including when you walk and run.
¬†
This test of hip stability is called the Trendelenburg test:
1. Stand with your hands on your hips to help you feel/visualize movement of the pelvis.
2. Bring one knee up to hip height and hold it there for 3 seconds. Repeat on the other side for 3 reps total.
4. Repeat for 2 reps per side. A little bit of weight shift side to side is expected.
¬†
Common faults:
A. Positive Trendelenburg sign: Hip drop on lifted side.
B. Modified Trendelenburg sign: Excessive rising of the hip on the lifted side OR torso leaning away from the lifted side.
C. Loss of balance.
¬†
When the gluteus medius doesn't work well, it can mean:
- The pelvis won't be stabilized as well. Because the low back is connected to the pelvis, this can lead to low back pain.
- The knees will be poorly aligned during movements such as squats and lunges.
- Excessive wear and tear on joints such as the spine, hip, and knee, which can lead to pain.
¬†
Try it out and let me know in the comments if you:
1. Had a perfect test!
2. Had one of the faults listed above. If so, which one?

3,2021-05-14T19:05:33+0000,"Isometric single arm row with a towel.
¬†
As I've written about so many times, the row is a fundamental exercise that should be in every good strength training program: It helps you improve your posture by training the upper back muscles that hold your shoulders and upper spine in good position. Performing it isometrically using a towel is a great no-equipment option. Isometric exercises (where the muscles are working even when the joints remain fixed) are scientifically shown to:
- Increase strength even without weights/machines.
- Have a painkilling effect for the involved structures.
- Allow for maximal effort with less risk than with traditional strength training.
¬†
Tips:
Make sure you feel the muscles on the back of and in between your shoulder blades working, not just your biceps/arms.
You should not feel any tension in your upper traps or on the front of your shoulders. If you do, pull shoulder blades down and back with each pull.
Avoid holding your breath so blood pressure doesn't get too high.
¬†
Let me know how it goes if you give a try!

The push up is a strength exercise that doesn't require equipment, but doing them without balancing them out with other exercises can make our shoulders and posture worse than they already are. Here's an exercise requiring no equipment that helps keep you improve posture and keep the shoulders pain-free.

3. While keeping your shoulder blades in that position, lift your arms off the floor and hold. Keep the arms in line with the shoulder (don't let them drift towards the body) and shoulders away from the ears (not shrugged).
4. Hold for 10 seconds for 6-10 reps. Feel the muscles in between and on the surface of the shoulder blade activate. For more challenge, perform while holding 1-3lb weights.

5,2021-05-10T20:44:16+0000,"Having good posture and shoulder health in the modern world requires us to train upper body pulling movements such as rows, but what if you don't have any gym equipment and aren't strong enough to do a pull up? The reverse plank can be done without any gym equipment.
¬†
Tips:
- This can be done for reps and/or as a hold for time. 
- Pull the shoulders and elbows back to hold the position and you'll feel the muscles on the back of the shoulder and between the shoulder blades working. 
- You will also be using the muscles on the back of the thighs and glutes. Keep the low back flat (tailbone tucked down) to avoid feeling pressure in the low back (feel abs and glutes work to do this).

In our modern world, certain muscles require more attention to counteract all the sitting and desk work we do.

If you have trouble feeling your upper back muscles working when doing things like rows and pull ups, this exercise can wake them up and help your shoulders move better and improve your posture.

1. Lie on your stomach with your head resting on the floor and arms reached forward in a Y shape (about 45 deg angle from the head).
2. Reach arms forward as high as you can, shrugging the shoulders.
3. Pull your shoulders away from the floor and away from your ears.
4. While keeping your shoulder blades in that position, lift your arms off the floor and hold. It is more important to keep the upper arms reached forward than to lift the arms high.
5. Hold for 10 seconds for 6-10 reps. Feel the muscles in between and on the surface of the shoulder blade activate. For more challenge, perform while holding 1-3lb weights.

7,2021-05-05T19:52:01+0000,"Lunges are a foundational movement pattern, but they can be challenging to start with due to coordination and even due to muscle tightness in the front of the thigh/hip (super common!). Here's a variation that is a great starting point and also trains lower body strength to get up and down from the floor without using the arms.
¬†
Key points:
- Keep the hip, knee, and ankle of the front foot aligned when viewed from the front.
- Imagine pushing that front foot into the floor to get up.
- Descend with control to enhance strength improvement.
- Progress by holding weight. If you really want to challenge your stability and have the ability, perform it while holding a weight overhead!

The sunglasses I wore during yesterday's cycling adventure broke while I carried them in my fanny pack. Normally I buy sunglasses from the drug store, but these were the double-polarized ones the eye doctor recommended after my laser eye surgery, so went to the post office to send them for repair even though shipping costs 2-3x the cost of a new pair from London Drugs. I used this post office trip to practise making hand signals while on the bike and managed to make a 1-sec turn signal at some of my turns.

10,2021-05-02T02:33:00+0000,"Last year I learned to ride a bike and my first big bike trip was 30 min to QE Park. I wasn't able to pedal fast enough to keep my bike moving up the hill, so had to get off and walk. Today was my first time biking outside all year. This time, I pedalled up the hill and only stopped at the top to cross the street. So I took the chance to take a commemorative selfie. Also had my first ice cream of the year.

On the first couple days of learning to bike, I thought it was impossible. On day 2, my abs felt tired from stiffening up to stabilize. The only reason I persisted is that if people with worse coordination than me can do it, I should be able to also. After 7 straight days of practice, I was able to bike (with relaxed abs)!

My clients often get frustrated when they can't get certain exercises right initially. If you're experiencing the same thing, just know that it's normal and that with deliberate practice, the body will learn and improve just like how I learned to bike. I still need practice to learn to make turn signals without losing control of the bike.",44,2,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/181374881_526116615047778_7323079692121172024_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=84IJmQnko5MAX_K6iZW&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfDswUWzuRARwl_SBPojwtbJOL7oct95_2AitEMoOue_Vw&oe=63D71B61,https://www.instagram.com/p/COWpvPcMDz3/,17938380367468487,"[{'timestamp': '2021-05-02T04:34:45+0000', 'text': 'I get excited for the 1st of the month for ice cream seasonal flavor announcements üòÇ', 'username': 'westcoastwanderlusting', 'like_count': 0, 'replies': {'data': [{'timestamp': '2021-05-02T04:56:57+0000', 'text': '@westcoastwanderlusting , now you can even get ice cream delivered on DoorDash!', 'username': 'silvialiftsweights', 'like_count': 1, 'id': '17930581633547455'}]}, 'id': '18114970903212251'}]",

12,2021-04-14T16:55:31+0000,"""How many reps should I do?""
¬†
It depends. If your goal is to be able to have the endurance to perform an action for several repetitions, such as bending over when giving your baby a bath, then using lighter weight performed with higher reps would improve that.
¬†
If your goal is to be able to increase how much weight you can lift, such as being able to move a couch or compete in max lifting, then you'll have to use lower reps to increase how much weight you can lift.
¬†
Long term, you want to train both low, moderate, and high repetitions to improve both muscular endurance, strength, and growth. A good fitness coach can help you plan the right program for you.
¬†
Are you guilty of only training a certain number of reps?

16,2021-03-31T18:57:15+0000,"Believe it or not, one of my rituals before a heavy Olympic lift is an exercise I often recommend to improve posture and counteract long periods of desk work (no, not twerking).
¬†
Can you guess what it is? It does not involve any weight at all. See the second video for the full exercise demonstration.
¬†
It's an exercise called the wall angel, which involves standing with your back against a wall and sliding your arms overhead while keeping the arms in contact with the wall. The same motion can also be done without the wall (but the wall lets you know if you're cheating). This exercise requires several things which help promote good posture and shoulder function (which is why I do in preparation to catch a heavy weight overhead):
- Thoracic extension.
- Shoulder retraction.
- Upward rotation of the scapula.
- Overhead reaching.
¬†
Are you able to keep the arms on the wall while reaching straight overhead without arching the low back? Try it out and comment below!

17,2021-03-26T18:36:16+0000,"Striving to be the best has a cost, and sometimes it‚Äôs not worth it.
¬†
Back when I was competing in Olympic lifting in 2016-2018, I had big ambitions for my sport performance. Being the typical Type A personality, sport performance consumed my thoughts. It was not rational because some of the things I did (e.g. sacrificing sleep to train, undereating to keep bodyweight low) ultimately costed me my health and thus limited my performance despite all those hours training and thinking about nutrition. Sadly, I chose this hobby over my work.
¬†
Tomorrow is my first @bcweightlifting competition since 2018. My mindset towards training is different these days. I place more importance on helping others get stronger and healthier AND still achieve their career goals. My results in Olympic lifting don't indicate my value as a person. No one cares how much I lift. I'll never be a Type B personality, but have definitely moved closer towards it, and this has helped my well-being.
¬†
Are you a Type A personality? Can you relate to how this is not always a good thing?

- It can improve your posture by mobilizing body parts that often get tight with sitting (e.g. pecs, lats, thoracic spine).
- It decompresses the low back, specifically the discs. These discs get compressed when you sit for a long time, which can lead to problems. For some people with back pain, this decompression can provide relief.
- It strengthens your grip and shoulders (including your rotator cuff muscles).
- It's FUN! Tap into your inner child.

Where do you like to hang (literally)? Would you feel comfortable hanging at your workplace to break up periods of sitting?

Part 5

Back pain affects those with physical jobs AND those with desk jobs. When you feel limited in what you can do, that negatively impacts your mental state, which ultimately contributes to more pain.

Instead of thinking about the pain what you CAN'T do, seek to improve what you CAN do. Even if pain level stays the same, you are making progress if you are able to DO more without worsening your condition.

Not sure what options are safe for you? Seek help from a qualified exercise professional or physiotherapist.

What activities give you a self of achievement? For me, it's lifting heavy things, or in this case, pulling my bodyweight up!

Back pain affects those with physical jobs AND those with desk jobs. Here is some thing to consider: Exercise changes the entire physiology of the body both short- and long-term, including reduce chronic inflammation and pain. While some rest or reduced activity may be needed initially, staying sedentary for extended periods will worsen not just your health, but could make the pain persist. Find a form of exercise that doesn't aggravate your symptoms and your body will thank you.

What's your experience with modifying your exercise plans due to injury?¬†

Part 3

Fix your position and make low back pain go away.

People will often blame certain exercises for causing pain, but sometimes the issue is how they are executing the movement rather than the actual exercise.

Push ups were all the rage at the start of the pandemic. Unfortunately, most people doing push ups are not getting the full benefit of them (including some really strong/buff people). Did you know the push up also engages the abs and glutes when done properly?

When you let the low back arch, you're not engaging the abs and glutes. This arched back can cause low back discomfort during the push up and other movements/exercises.

Do you feel your abs and glutes during push ups?

Today I did squats, and my fear of the weight almost stopped me. I started my first warm up set with 16 kg less than my goal weight for the day. It felt heavy and I was nervous. I added 10 kg. It felt heavier. I doubted my ability. Added another 3 kg, which was still 3kg lighter than the goal weight. I got more nervous, but focused on key points for proper set up and execution. In the end, I managed to do 4 sets at the goal weight.

Even when it feels tough, you are likely capable of much more. I don't like discomfort and avoid risk. My first personal trainer taught me how to push when the weight feels heavy, but it's still something I struggle with.

Do you get paralysis by analysis? When did you last surprise yourself with what you could do by pushing out of your comfort zone?

When employers such as @kaianalytics invest in the wellbeing of their staff through at-work activities (such as this workshop we did last week), not only do staff get the resources to keep their bodies feeling better, but are more likely to actually IMPLEMENT these things because they don't have to find the time to do it on their own outside work hours.

Training for results requires patience and consistency. The science of motivation is shows that if you don‚Äôt enjoy the process and can't understand how the actions align with who you are, you are less likely to make exercise stick.

While doing the same exercise routine week to week did not provide the same entertainment as doing a different group fitness workout every time, seeing measurable progress was a reward in itself. Seeing the results of your consistency is also a daily reminder that you are acting in accordance to who you want to be.

I'll admit, it's been tough to get in my steps these past 2 weeks. One strong motivation for me to walk has been to replenish my favourite carb source--kabocha squash!

I've been trying to figure out how to select the tastiest specimens. For me, that means kabocha that are sweet with a dry, potato-like texture. Sometimes I'm disappointed with moist, underripe ones. If you've figured it out, let me know!

¬†
Empty your bladder and take off your sweater. Less weight to lift, right?
¬†
Last week I got a personal record of 5 chin ups. Today was the day of my max chin up/pull up contest with @tak_lift and @fitnesswithryo and I was doubtful I would be able to add even 1 more rep. On the first set (2nd video), I surprised myself with 7 reps. I then did 200 reps of light leg isolation work, emptied my bladder, and got EIGHT reps on my next attempt (1st video).
¬†
3 days ago, I literally peed my pants doing a single pull up, as well as on a light front squat. It just goes to show that sometimes you can surprise yourself, and how you can have strong days and weak days. (Or maybe it was all those banded leg curls and leg extensions that @coachjure had me do that helped me get that extra chin up?!)
¬†
What's your craziest story of going from weak to strong (or vice-versa) in just a few days, and what do you think caused the big change?

@dundundolphin__ @kingdomofjoy @yogisophy , look forward to seeing your chin ups/pull ups!

I'm currently working on improve the number of chin ups I can do (I know, the last ones are not pretty). The most surprising part about pull ups/chin ups is how much the abs are involved, and how a lack of ab activation can prevent me pulling myself up.

¬†
Strategy #2: Rain or shine, or even snow! Just dress appropriately.
¬†
I was tempted to skip my morning walk today, but reminded myself how important good sleep is. Two weeks ago, I accidentally discovered that I was able to fix my sleep problems after starting my day with a walk. Before, I would frequently wake up in the middle of the night and not be able to fall back asleep, which would cause me to feel lethargic and crave more food.
¬†
Here's the science: The exposure to natural daylight first thing in the morning helps us to calibrate our body clocks so that we can sleep well at night.

¬†
Strategy #1: Awkward dancing at the desk.
¬†
I often recommended to my clients with fat loss goals to aim to get 8000+ steps per day and now I know why so many of them have such a tough time doing so--the only way to do that when you work at a desk all day is to actually get away from the desk--until now! Now that I have switched to training clients 100% online, I decided this month that I would aim to get 8000 steps per day. When it's too dark out and I still have work to do, dancing at the desk helps me get more steps.

PS, that vest I am wearing is a weighted vest.

The truth is, good trainers have extensive education about the body, movement, and exercise. Unless you're willing to go through years of education and get practical experience coaching hundreds of real people, trying to figure out on your own is just not the same as getting customized guidance from an experienced trainer who is constantly learning.

‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
As much as I love Olympic weightlifting, which involves creating power with your lower body to generate momentum to lift a heavy weight over head, it is not where most people should start. However, there are kettlebell variations of the Olympic lifts that teach you how to move with high speed.

üèãÔ∏èThe double arm single kettlebell clean (or high pull to catch) is my go-to exercise to introduce someone to creating power with the legs. I have found that those with desk jobs tend to forget how to create power from their lower body (especially the glutes) and instead compensate with their low back and upper body when lifting.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢¬†
Tips:
üëâFirst, make sure you know how to perform a deadlift using primarily your lower body instead of feeling pressure in your low back.
Warm up with few reps of deadlifts using the kettlebell.
üëâThe lower body should initiate the lift powerfully from the floor. Imagine pushing the floor away from you to create more power, almost like you're about to jump.
üëâThe hands should grip the kettlebell lightly so they can slide along the handle.
üëâQuickly tuck the elbows into the sides of your body as you receive the kettlebell at chest height.
üëâIf you're doing it right, you should feel the glutes working hard with no pressure in the low back.

I was once a young scientist (glasses and all!) measuring muscle activity on human volunteers. I spent hours in the lab to figure out equipment, run experiments, and process data. I did so much mouse clicking that I had to eventually switch to using the mouse with my left hand to avoid repetitive strain injuries.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
To be honest, I don't know if all those hours in the lab will ever have ANY positive contribution to science. After I finished my Masters degree, I spent months applying to research jobs, but didn't get a single offer. Looking back, this was a blessing. It caused me to think about how to best make use of my education. Not long after starting a job as a kinesiologist in a physiotherapy clinic, I felt grateful for being able to impact the health of individuals. After 4 years in the clinic, I realized that instead of helping people only AFTER they got injured, I wanted to help people stay injury-free, and that is why I switched to personal training.

I discovered through coding that I get into a flow state when I get to solve problems. I leverage this strength in my approach as a fitness professional: I use science to solve problems and get results.

Often, the problems to be solved involve finding the time and motivation to ACTUALLY DO the things.

7,2021-01-01T17:13:36+0000,"Should you do more cardio if your goal is fat loss?
¬†
üö¥I've gotten into the habit lately of doing light cycling whenever I'm on a call that is not work-related. It's just another way to avoid being sedentary that doesn't require any thinking.
¬†
üëâOften when people want to lose fat, they think that adding cardio is the best way to go. This may work, but it also may NOT work long-term for some reasons:
- If the cardio exercise is fatiguing, your body may move less the rest of the day, thus cancelling out any energy deficit that the cardio may have created. Even if you spend 1 hour doing cardio, the remaining 23 hours a day will have a bigger impact on your total energy expenditure.
- Moderate-intensity cardio may increase appetite, so you may end up eating more. It's very easy to eat more calories than what you burn through exercise.
- Certain cardio activities like jogging/running make it harder to gain and maintain muscle mass.
¬†
üåàCardiovascular exercise is super beneficial for health, but for fat loss (especially if you're a time-crunched professional), consider these other things as the main part of your fat loss strategy:
‚úîÔ∏èNutrition. It takes a lot of work to burn 300 calories but all it takes is a fancy latte to consume it.
‚úîÔ∏èLight movement throughout the day (e.g. walking), which significantly impacts calorie burn without causing more fatigue or increasing appetite. The scientific term for this is non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT). I actually consider my light cycling during phone calls to be a form of NEAT because i's like going for a walk, but on a bike.
‚úîÔ∏èResistance (weight) training to avoid muscle loss during weight loss. This helps you maintain your metabolic rate.
¬†‚Ä¢
If you want help with the above, now is your chance to get some professional guidance and accountability with it.

8,2021-01-01T01:14:23+0000,"How is your squat form?
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
The squat is such a great exercise, but I am honestly surprised when I can see someone do it with good depth and great form. Even fitness professionals and super strong lifters commonly do it with ""butt wink"", i.e. when the tailbone tucks down at the bottom position. This means that the spine is bending and the pelvis might be in a less stable position, which causes excessive stress on the low back with heavy or frequent squatting. While it may not necessarily cause back pain or injury, I recommend erring on the side of caution--it may be just a matter of time or unfortunate circumstances.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
This video explains the first things I'll try to help someone correct butt wink. If those things and practice with a mirror don't work, I would then look at checking ankle and hip mobility, which can also limit butt wink-free squat depth.

üëâTips:
‚úîÔ∏è- From start to finish of every rep, keep your tail bone tucked down (belly button pointing to your nose) so your low back doesn't arch excessively.
‚úîÔ∏è- Keep your body in a straight line from head to knees. Do not bend at the hips when lowering. You will feel your glutes engage if you do this.
‚úîÔ∏è- Only go as low as you can while keeping your low back flat. Push your arms down and pull them towards you to get back to the start position (don't stick the butt up as you return).

To put more emphasis on the glues, which are important for stabilizing the hips to reduce wear and tear of the low back and knees, make the movement more dynamic as shown in this variation.

Tight hip flexors can contribute to

‚òπÔ∏èSleepy (and thus flatter) glutes
‚òπÔ∏èBack or knee pain
¬†
Key points for properly stretching your hip flexors:
‚úîÔ∏èTuck your tailbone so your belly button points to your nose. This involves engaging the abs and glutes on the back leg.
‚úîÔ∏èRaise the arm and twist and/or side bend towards the front leg as shown.
‚úîÔ∏èFeel the stretch in front of the hip of the back leg.
‚úîÔ∏èPerform the stretch for about 30 seconds dynamically (~4-5 reps), then hold the stretch statically for 30 seconds.

Tips:
üëâAlways initiate the movement by pulling the shoulders back, and keep the shoulder blades back until the very end of the rep.
üëâLower the weight down slowly to get the best training effect.

¬†
üí™The row is a fundamental exercise that should be in every good strength training program: It helps you improve your posture by training the upper back muscles that hold your shoulders and upper spine in good position. It's also exercise you can progressively get stronger in. Performing it with a band is a great option for the home, as well as if you're rehabilitating from an injury.
¬†
Tips:
‚úÖThe shoulder blades move forward and backward with each rep, not just the arms.
‚úÖMake sure you feel the muscles on the back of and in between your shoulder blades working, not just your biceps/arms.
‚ùåYou should not feel any tension in your upper traps or on the front of your shoulders. If you do, pull shoulder blades down and back with each pull.

¬†
üèãÔ∏èThe squat is such a great exercise, but I am honestly surprised when I can see someone do it with good depth and great form. Even fitness professionals and super strong lifters commonly do it with ""butt wink"", i.e. when the tailbone tucks down at the bottom position. This means that the spine is bending and the pelvis might be in a less stable position, which causes excessive stress on the low back with heavy or frequent squatting. While it may not necessarily cause back pain or injury, I recommend erring on the side of caution--it may be just a matter of time or unfortunate circumstances.
¬†
üëâThis video explains the first things I'll try to help someone correct butt wink. If those things and practice with a mirror don't work, I would then look at checking ankle and hip mobility, which can also limit butt wink-free squat depth.

I'm looking for 1-2 time-crunched professionals who want to lose 5-15 lbs and feel energized in 12 weeks even with a sedentary office job. It's a remote program starting on Monday Jan 4th, so you can join from anywhere in the world. If that's you, comment 'tell me more' below and I'll message to see if it's right for you.

üí™Here's my entry into the fun contest I had with fitnesswithryo and takuma_oki to see who could get the heaviest bent press! My shoulder stability was super challenged and I had a minor hamstring strain on subsequent failed attempts.

üòúThe first video was taken 3 days ago, and while I did re-attempt it with the same weight, today my upper body seemed too pooped to stabilize (I would have re-attempted it sooner had I not strained my left hamstring, LOL).

‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
This exercise not only trains the upper body, but also teaches you how to maintain core stability by keeping the abs and glutes tight. Tall kneeling is also a great option if you find the band too tight to perform a standing shoulder press.
One advantage of using a band vs. weights is that you can press the weight overhead at an angle in case you don't quite have the shoulder mobility to press completely vertically.

‚ùì Are there any movements or muscles that you're not sure how to train at home with or without bands? Comment below and I might just make a video on this.

üëâKeep your front knee in line with an imaginary line running from the hip and ankle (front view).
üëâLean slightly forward at the torso to engage your glutes more.
üëâYou don't need to kill your legs to get the benefits: Start with even 5 per side, walk for a few minutes to recover, then repeat. Something is better than nothing!

2,2020-12-18T20:07:09+0000,"Use it or lose it! If you never have to reach or lift overhead, there's a good chance you will lose this ability. Overhead lifting can help you keep your shoulders healthy. Here's how to do an overhead press in a half kneeling position, which helps you minimize pressure on the low back:
1. Get into a half kneeling position as shown.
2. Hold the weight in the working arm (opposite to front leg) with the palm facing towards you.
3. Press the weight straight up. Rotate the arm so that the palm is facing away from you in the final position.
¬†
‚ùå Don't allow the ribs to flare out or back to arch to avoid putting pressure in the back.

‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
If you're looking to spend a little bit on exercise equipment, bands are probably the best option to start with: They're easy to travel with, inexpensive, and versatile. Additionally, they have one advantage you won't get with weights: the resistance level changes during the movement.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
This property, known as accommodating resistance, is useful in several exercises such as the shoulder press. When this movement is performed with regular weights, the effort normally diminishes as the hands approach the top of the movement due to the physics of gravity. When performed with bands, the band provides more resistance as it gets stretched such that the movement requires more uniform effort throughout the entire range. You can also make the resistance heavier or lighter by adjusting how you grip the band or by layering bands.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Are there any movements or muscles that you're not sure how to train at home with or without bands? Comment below and I might just make a video on this.

¬†
üçëThis exercise starts off similarly as the regular glute bridge, but on the way down, you're only using one leg. This makes the exercise not only heavier, but requires more hip and core stabilization.
¬†
1. Lie on your back with your feet together close to your butt.
2. Lift your hips up by peeling your body off the floor starting from the butt until the body forms a straight line from the knees to shoulders. The low back should remain flat (think about pointing the belly button to the nose).
 3. While keeping the hip bones level, bring one knee to your chest so you're only supported on one leg. Hold for the indicated time before lowering down on only the supporting leg.
¬†
When you lift one leg up, don't let the hip of the unsupported side drop down--this requires you to engage the core and glutes. The wider apart your feet are at the start, the harder it will be to keep the hips level, so start with the feet touching together.

8,2020-12-11T17:16:52+0000,"Strengthen and stretch at the same time! As a busy professional, you value your time. Bulgarian split squats strengthen your legs and glutes, as well as stretch the muscles on the front of the thigh and hip. The great thing about this form of stretching is that the flexibility improvement is longer lasting than with a traditional static stretch because you're actually engaging the muscles, which tells the brain that it's safe for your body to be in that stretched position.

‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
No time for gym and no weights at home? No problem. Once you've mastered the split squat, adding a jump will force your muscles to work harder so you move faster. It will also train good landing mechanics--if you can do it properly. Tips for good execution:
üëâThe feet should be about hip width apart from side to side.
üëâFrom the front view (i.e. if watching yourself in the mirror), the hip, knee, and ankle of the front leg should remain in one line, especially as you land.
üëâWhen descending, the front foot should remain flat on the floor while only the ball of the back foot in contact with the floor. Both feet should remain pointing forward.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
To advance:
üëâIncrease repetitions.
üëâAim higher.
Switch the leg positions mid air to land with the opposite leg forward.
üëâWant to give this a try but not sure if you're doing it correctly? Post a video and tag me, or send me the video in a DM.

I had not done Olympic lifting for 3 weeks, and had not trained consistently overall the week leading up to this moment. I came to lift to do my submission for the virtual clean & Jerk competitition between @takuma_oki and I had low expectations, and my attempt with 8kg less almost crushed me. Yet somehow, I got a personal record (for squat jerk).

Perhaps it was the fancy Eleiko bar, or having teammates cheering me on, or the fact that I was chill as a cucumber instead of being too concerned about missing.

In the past, I would have been upset about not winning. I was once at a seminar where I was bothered because I couldn't deadlift as much as the other women (who where all bigger than me and actual competitive powerlifters). I then realized that this sort of comparison was a source of a lot of unnecessary unhappiness over something so trivial. 

There's a bright side and dark side to everything. This friendly competition gave me the motivation to snatch more consistently.

19,2020-10-04T03:39:26+0000,"These lifts were far from perfect. I almost dropped the bar/lost balance, but my body managed to stabilize everything enough (not bad for a 2RM personal record). The body is amazing--it reacts to stabilize before you can consciously think about it. The more you train stability, the better the body becomes at stabilizing automatically. Performing strengthening exercises with free weights and in unstable postures (e.g. single leg) can train both stability and strength at the same time (Bosu balls optional).

20,2020-09-25T22:35:03+0000,"Knee pain is super common. A couple years ago, both my knees were achy anytime I squatted or lunged with bodyweight. Oddly enough, with heavy weight, I did not feel knee pain. These days, my left knee still clicks uncomfortably with light squats/lunges, but when I use heavy weight OR concentrate on tensing up my muscles more, the clicking goes away. When I hit a personal record on the squat jerk last week, my left knee felt fine.

Knee pain can have many difference causes. If you feel clicking or grinding in the knees, it might be from muscle imbalances/tightness causing the knee cap to not glide properly as the knee bends/straightens. I suspect this is what's going on in my left knee right now. If your quadricep muscles are really tight, it could compress the knee cap as you bend the knees, as was happening to both my knees a couple years ago. If your knees are poorly aligned (valgus) during squatting, lunging, climbing, or running, that causes extra stress on the knees and can lead to pain also. All these causes of pain can be addressed using movement and lifestyle--don't just accept that you have ""bad knees"" if you haven't been properly assessed. Comment below if you have achy knees and could use some help!

üí™üèªI haven‚Äôt attempted to do such heavy Olympic lifts since 2018 and was pleasantly surprised how strong (and chill!) I felt given that I've been practising only once a week instead of 4-5 times per week like back then. This lift was 1 kg shy of my personal record.

Most people can still get stronger with age because most don't push close to their genetic potential. Train intelligently and manage your diet, stress, and sleep well and the gainz will keep coming.

24,2020-09-09T17:35:11+0000,"Morning low intensity cardio on the indoor bike trainer.
In the first 3 minutes, I thought there was NO WAY the burning in my legs would allow me to continue for 30+ minutes at 60-70% maximum heart rate, but after 3 minutes, the burn subsided and my body was in cruise control.
Warming up is not simply for injury prevention. The processes in your body actually take time to ramp up to the level necessary for efficient exertion. This applies for both cardio activities and strength/power activities. A proper warm up at light intensity allows for the following minutes/sets to be better.
¬†
Thanks to Wilson for lending me his bike trainer. Now I have no excuse to do cardio!

0,2020-09-04T16:50:46+0000,"The importance of feedback.
¬†
I'm on week 3 of my program, which involves doing med ball slams for 30 sec with a target heart rate of 85-90% max HR. Because I had heart rate feedback, this week I pushed myself harder and FINALLY reached the prescribed intensity. It's so easy to think you're working hard but actually still have more in the tank. That's why it's great to get coaching and feedback.
¬†
When I first saw people slam things on the floor in gyms, I thought it was dumb. I now realize it can be a great safe way to express power and intensity, but ONLY if you actually push.

1,2020-08-21T16:08:50+0000,"The basic plank is a great exercise that is a much better option than crunches/sit ups because they train the core muscles in the same way they would be used in daily life--by keeping the torso stable against external forces.
¬†
Here's a plank variation to challenge your core (and shoulders!) even more: the plank with alternating leg lift.
üëâ Start with the elbows directly under the shoulders, forearms parallel to each other, chest pushed away from the floor (not sunken down).
üëâ Slowly peel yourself inch by inch off the floor¬†starting the upper abdomen down to the knees. As you do so, you will your abdominals activate starting from the top to the bottom.
üëâ Keep back flat by pointing the belly button to the nose. In the final position, the body should almost form a straight line from head to feet. You will feel your butt and abs work to hold the position. Don't let your lower back arch. 
üëâ Alternate between picking each foot off the floor while keeping the rest of the body still--don't let the hips/torso rotate. Perform 5 lifts per side. Rest and repeat for 3-6 sets.

3,2020-08-18T20:04:59+0000,"This past week, deadlifts felt tough, so I took it easy and used it as a chance to practice deadlifting with a belt--something I've rarely done. For the first time, the belt actually seemed to help me lift more easily and with less soreness from what I assume are the quadratus lumborum. After a few days of taking it easy, today, I broke a beltless deadlifting personal record and a belted deadlifting record. I'm 5 lbs away from a double body weight deadlift! As you can see, I failed the first attempt. On the second attempt, I made sure to both #squeezetheanus and better engage the lats (still something I need to remind myself of).
What cues do you use for yourself when doing a lift or complex movement?

I had a basket installed on my bike by @cyclecityshop so was able to carry two more packs of @zevia instead of just the 2 in my backpack. As I was taking the selfie, it sounded like someone driving past yelled ""Hey, girl, get a job!"" Seems she is a lot less happy with her job/life than I am with mine.
I can also make U-turns pretty well now. Just need to work on making hand signals without swerving!

¬†
üçëThis exercise starts off similarly as the regular glute bridge, but on the way down, you're only using one leg. This makes the exercise not only heavier, but requires more hip and core stabilization.
¬†
1. Lie on your back with your feet together close to your butt.
2. Lift your hips up by peeling your body off the floor starting from the butt until the body forms a straight line from the knees to shoulders. The low back should remain flat (think about pointing the belly button to the nose).
 3. While keeping the hip bones level, bring one knee to your chest so you're only supported on one leg. Hold for the indicated time before lowering down on only the supporting leg.
¬†
When you lift one leg up, don't let the hip of the unsupported side drop down--this requires you to engage the core and glutes. The wider apart your feet are at the start, the harder it will be to keep the hips level, so start with the feet touching together.

8,2020-08-04T18:58:45+0000,"Are your glutes SLEEPY? In the modern world, it's common for the glutes to be sleepy, which can cause back or knee issues. The glute bridge is a great exercise to correct this. Here's how to do it:
1. Lie on your back with your feet close to your butt at about hip width or wider. You can have your feet pointed slightly outwards.
2. Lift your hips up by peeling your body off the floor starting from the butt until the body forms a straight line from the knees to shoulders. The knees should move in line with the feet. The low back should remain flat (think about pointing the belly button to the nose).
 3. Hold for the indicated time before lowering down.
¬†
üëâ You should primarily feel the muscles in the butt working and no strain from the low back.
üëâ Experiment with different stance widths to find the width that allows for the most activation in the gluteal (butt) muscles.
üëâ If you feel pressure in the low back, maintain a flatter back throughout the movement.
üëâ If you feel more work from the back of the thighs than in the butt, imagine pushing your feet away from you body (without actually moving them) in the final position.

üëâ During lunges, it's normal to feel muscle fatigue/soreness, but if you feel pain on the inside the knee or around/below the knee cap, that is NOT normal. A common problem that can eventually cause knee pain is when the knee caves in as shown in the video. ""Bad knees"" and/or flat feet can often be improved by addressing muscle imbalances.

13,2020-07-31T19:48:36+0000,"I added lateral lunges to my routine 3 weeks ago. I started with 44 lbs and my butt and inner thighs were unusually sore the next couple days. Today, I did them with 77 lbs but probably won't feel much soreness from it because I've been doing them 1-2x/week. Looking back at the videos side by side, I can see that I went deeper with the lighter weights, which makes it harder and requires more hip and ankle mobility.

üëúYou can train your core without any equipment and without getting down on the floor. The suitcase carry is one such exercise: Hold something heavy in one arm (filled briefcase/purse, bag of groceries, water cooler jug) and walk with good posture--the core on one side will be working harder to keep you from leaning to one side. 

üïóI talk to a lot of busy professionals who know that exercise will help their bodies counteract their sedentary jobs, but don't end up doing it because after a long work day and other obligations, the energy and motivation to exercise is not there. My #1 advice is to do just do one exercise, even if it's just for one repetition.

I am super picky about push up form and am skeptical when people talk about their push up numbers. Not only did she smash her push up record, but she also gained 2.5"" on her broad jump in the past month! 

In February, Sara was able to do 4 push ups. Since re-starting personal training in June, she's been doing incline/elevated push ups on a 6"" box with perfect form and slow negatives. If there's one magic bullet in strength training, it's probably slow negatives. Look forward to helping  Sara get her first chin up and other personal bests!

My #1 advice is to do just do one exercise, even if it's just for one repetition. I love the split squat because it helps counteract the weak core, right hips, and achy joints that can result from sitting all day. For beginners, just 8-12 reps may be challenging! For some, this exercise can be modified several ways to be more challenging.

18,2020-07-28T13:21:22+0000,"Prone T back extension.
By changing the position of your arms, you can make the prone back extension more/less challenging for the low back muscles. The T position can also help you target the postural muscles of the shoulder.
üëâ Lie on your stomach with your arms out the sides and thumbs pointing up to the ceiling.
üëâ Lift your head and shoulders just slightly off the floor, keeping the head/neck aligned with the torso (face should you facing the floor). Then lift the arms off the floor.
üëâ To engage the core and low back muscles more, imagine lifting everything above the hips off the floor (even though the abdomen remains on the floor).
üëâ Don't arch your back excessively. To minimize pressure on the low back, you can perform this with a cushion or Bosu ball underneath your lower stomach. I advise against lifting the legs because this makes it harder to maintain a neutral spine.
üëâ Don't let the shoulders shrug towards your ears--the upper trapezius muscles are overactive in many people already, so no need to make that worse.

19,2020-07-28T02:08:45+0000,"To maintain good posture and minimize low back injury, you need good endurance of the back muscles that run along the spine. This can easily be trained at home with the prone back extension.
üëâ Lie on your stomach.
üëâ Lift your head and shoulders just slightly off the floor, keeping the head/neck aligned with the torso (face should you facing the floor).
üëâ To engage the core and low back muscles more, imagine lifting everything above the hips off the floor (even though the abdomen remains on the floor).
üëâ Don't arch your back excessively. To minimize pressure on the low back, you can perform this with a cushion or Bosu ball underneath your lower stomach. I advise against lifting the legs because this makes it harder to maintain a neutral spine.

20,2020-07-26T02:37:54+0000,"Walking is a great way to incorporate movement AND get out in nature. If you want to strengthen your muscles while walking, simply perform some walking lunges during the walk! Tips:
üëâKeep your front knee in line with an imaginary line running from the hip and ankle (front view).
üëâLean slightly forward at the torso to engage your glutes more.
üëâYou don't need to kill your legs to get the benefits: Start with even 5 per side, walk for a few minutes to recover, then repeat. Something is better than nothing!

22,2020-07-20T04:49:01+0000,"Before doing this sumo deadlift personal record today, I failed my first 2 attempts with 5 lbs less weight. Guess what I told myself to help me succeed the lift?
#squeezetheanus üòÅ
This cue is not to squeeze the glutes, but actually to activate the pelvic floor muscles, which works with the core to stabilize the spine so you can express your full strength. I know for me it makes a difference when lifting heavy.
@takuma_oki helped me film this, and he and I will be competing end of Aug to see who has the best conventional deadlift and sumo deadlift to body weight ratio. Who will win? Who else wants to join?

üí™ It's exciting to hit personal records. In 2017/18, I trained ~10 hours a week without making any progress on the main lifts I was training for, likely from under eating and over stressing. In the past 11 months, I added 40 lbs to my conventional deadlift (which I started training in 2014) despite only training 2-4 hours per week average thanks to focusing on recovering health (and squeezing the anus). This shows that athletic improvements also depend on lifestyle and health, not just training alone.

Feel any pinching in the front of the hip at the bottom of the movement? That could be hip impingement which is something we don't want to feel repetitively. In my experience, that can usually be fixed with a posterior hip capsule stretch--message me if that's you need.Have more questions or want some more guidance on your fitness? Comment below!

Now she knows one specific stretch she can do before going to her fitness classes to help her hips feel good with every rep! Instead of avoiding certain exercises due to pain, a qualified trainer can actually help you figure out the specific things YOU need to do to keep your body feeling good. That way, you don't need to stretch the whole body or spend an hour at yoga when you're short on time (unless you want to, of course).

6,2020-07-11T00:26:59+0000,"Strengthen and stretch at the same time! As a busy professional, you value your time. Bulgarian split squats strengthen your legs and glutes, as well as stretch the muscles on the front of the thigh and hip. The great thing about this form of stretching is that the flexibility improvement is longer lasting than with a traditional static stretch because you're actually engaging the muscles, which tells the brain that it's safe for your body to be in that stretched position.

I remember the excitement that Yvonne had when she told me how she saw herself in the mirror and noticed how straight her back was. Like many millennials, the many hours of desk work meant that Yvonne had developed a bit of a hunch back. She went to the massage therapist regularly to relieve her achy neck. During the quarantine time, Yvonne continued with personal training virtually and followed the home exercise program I made for her. Despite not being able to see the massage therapist, her neck doesn't hurt as much as before!

Nathan works many hours and tended to skip exercise and make less ideal nutrition choices when life got crazy. I love helping people like Nathan break away from the all-or-nothing mentality so they can stay consistent with exercise and nutrition even when life is hectic.

10,2020-07-09T21:45:11+0000,"A lot of no-equipment home workouts involve lots of jumping around to make things challenging. A client I spoke with said that one of the barriers for her to exercise is that all the a jumping in the home workout videos she's been using makes her chest hurt because she doesn't have a good enough sports bra--not something that has ever occurred to me! üòÖ
Jumping and plyometrics are great, but they're not the only way to get effective home workouts (not to mention that they are not appropriate for everyone). You can still get stronger at home by using household objects combined with smart exercise programming. In the case of the squat, add a hold at the bottom and fill up a suitcase, and you've got a joint-friendly way to strengthen those legs that will also help you maintain good form.

13,2020-07-08T15:47:59+0000,"Side plank hip tap on knees.
The side plank is an exercise for the core AND the glutes (particularly the side glutes, or gluteus medius). The side plank hip tap is a variation that gets these glutes to work a little harder. If the full side plank is too challenging, perform side planks with the knees on the floor.
Tips:
üëâBend at the hips, not at the waist/spine.
üëâPush the hips forward at the top position to fully lock out (extend) the hips.
üëâHold the last rep for 10 seconds to further build endurance in the abs.
üëâYou should feel your abs and glutes working, but not pressure in the low back.

Single leg exercises are not only a great way to strengthen the legs without using any/much weight, but also keep your back and knees from being achy when you spend all day at your desk. The sliding foot helps a bit with balance while still forcing the other leg to do most of the work. Tips:
üëâ¬†Lean your chest forward slightly as you lower down to get those glutes firing.
üëâ¬†Keep the knee, hip and ankle on the front leg aligned and the foot pointing straight ahead.

Single leg exercises are not only a great way to strengthen the legs without using any/much weight, but also keep your back and knees from being achy when you spend all day at your desk. The sliding foot helps a bit with balance while still forcing the other leg to do most of the work. Tips:
üëâ ¬†Make sure to push your butt back and lean your chest forward as you lower down.
üëâ¬†Keep the knee, hip and ankle on the standing leg aligned and the foot pointing straight ahead.

21,2020-07-05T02:21:01+0000,"In daily activities, the body needs to move in different directions, so our exercise program should account for that. The lateral lunge is a great but tough exercise: it requires hip stability and mobility, inner thigh flexibility, and ankle mobility. Aside from the occasional demonstration to clients, this is the first time in months that I've included the lateral lunge in my own training. Excited to see how heavy I can load it and the glute gains to come. üçë @actiongaskin , took your advice.

24,2020-07-02T04:31:33+0000,"Mobility time! The ""push up walk out"" exercise is good for:
- Getting a stretch in the back of your legs (hamstrings).
- Activating the core.
- Activating muscles that stabilize the shoulders.
¬†
üëâ1. As you reach the hands to the floor, keep the knees as straight as you can to stretch the hamstrings.
üëâ2. The bottom position is a plank: Your body should form a straight line from the head to the feet. The neck should be aligned with the spine. The chest should be pushed away from the floor (this activates some shoulder stabilizing muscles).
üëâ3. As you return to the standing position, imagine pushing the floor away from you with your arms. Keep the knees as straight as you can.

During fast movements such as jumping, the body will tend to revert to patterns it is used to doing. For many people, the knees will tend to buckle towards each other, which is a sign that the body is not CONTROLLING the hip and ankle joints well--it's not simply the way you're built. This inward knee buckling leads to ACL injuries during fast changes in direction such as those seen in field sports, especially in women. When your glutes work better, not only will you be more bootylicious, but also keep your knees healthier and legs stronger. üçë Here are Lynda's jumps on the same day before and after an exercise she did to wake up the glutes and foot muscles.

‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
In a society where it is so easy to consume calories, eating according to hunger and satiety (e.g. homeostatic eating) is a foundational nutrition skill that would not only reduce rates of overweight and obesity, but also eliminate many of the anxieties surrounding food and bodyweight. There‚Äôs no need to count calories or eat only salads to get and stay at a healthy bodyweight. Furthermore, when you get used to experiencing brief periods of hunger, you learn that it‚Äôs not an emergency and can act accordingly (no need to grab that snack bar if you can wait a bit for a nutritious meal instead).

6,2020-06-27T21:32:47+0000,"Why am I so weak today?
Truth is, some days you'll feel strong, some days you'll feel weak. I could tell during my warm up that I was not as strong today but wanted to test out my 1 rep max anyway (as encouraged by @coach_jure) for the first time in years. After hitting a 1 rep max personal record, I failed all my subsequent attempts, even at the weight that I had done for 3 reps just 9 days prior. Perhaps I could have pushed harder but the failed attempt shook my confidence. Next time will be better.

So many things impact how strong you feel at a particular moment: environment, psychology, energy, stress, illness, sleep, nutrition, hormones (especially for women), etc. That's why it's important to look at the trend rather than get hung up on any one particular day.

In a fed state on a typical diet that includes carbohydrates, the body prioritizes burning carbohydrates over burning fat for energy. The body will shift towards using more fat for fuel when it is in a fasted state. If your body doesn‚Äôt spend much time in a fasted state because you‚Äôre eating/drinking carbs all day, it will be ‚Äúout of practice‚Äù with burning fat for fuel and thus be more reliant on carbohydrates for energy. If you‚Äôre not good at using fat for fuel, your brain and body will have a tough time if you haven‚Äôt eaten in a while, which means your energy, concentration, and mood will be worse. A healthy body should be able to use both carbohydrates and fat for fuel, as well as remain clear-headed during typical daily activities when fasted for several hours.

9,2020-06-26T17:12:33+0000,"How to fast without starving. 
Fasting sits on a continuum. On one end is eating/drinking calories all day. On the opposite end is eating nothing for weeks. Neither of these extremes is desirable. 
Intermittent fasting is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. It provides several health and body composition benefits and many people can adopt it fairly consistently long term, but it may not be doable for others. 
Also on the spectrum is simply waiting until you are hungry, or in a fasted state, before eating again. In a time where it‚Äôs so easy for us to access food quickly and eating is often done mindlessly while on Netflix or Instagram, the ability to eat according to hunger and fullness signals would not only reduce rates of overweight and obesity, but also eliminate many of the anxieties surrounding food and bodyweight. 
Here‚Äôs an approach everyone can use to get some of the benefits of intermittent fasting: Let your stomach growl before eating! This allows you to get some of the benefits from being in a fasted state for those health benefits.

13,2020-06-25T05:15:25+0000,"Snack to support yourself!
While I talk about why we should get comfortable with NOT snacking, everything is context dependent. There are definitely times when it is a good idea to eat even if not hungry, such as:
‚Ä¢ If your schedule only allows you to eat a certain times.
‚Ä¢ If you need to eat proactively to support physical training and recovery. Some athletes expend so much energy with training/competition that the only way they can eat enough food to support it is to eat when not hungry.
‚Ä¢ If you need optimal mental performance (e.g. writing an exam, perform surgery).
‚Ä¢ If you know that waiting until hungry will cause you to binge later.
‚Ä¢ You have some sort of medical condition or are taking medication that requires eating at certain times.
‚Ä¢ Snacking is the only way to avoid undereating.

‚Ä¢
If you tend to graze or drink caloric beverages throughout the day, or snack when not hungry, see how you feel with reducing the number of times you eat. This can look different depending on what you are currently doing: ‚Ä¢ If you drink creamy/sugary coffee/tea or pop between meals, cut them out or only have them with meals.
‚Ä¢ If you eat snacks at your desk while working, cut them out (even if they are healthy).
‚Ä¢ If you eat 5 times a day, try eating 4 times per day.
‚Ä¢ If you never experience a growling stomach between meals, wait until that happens before eating.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
There are no hard or fast rules about how to go about this experiment to get benefits. It can take time for you to adjust to eating less frequently. If your brain and body are used to running on carbohydrates most of the time, it will take time for you to become better at using fat for fuel. If you‚Äôre feeling really unwell (e.g. poor mood/energy, dizziness), take a more gradual approach and listen to your body. ‚Ä¢

17,2020-06-24T03:36:19+0000,"Squat myths busted!
‚ùå Myth: You must keep your feet hip width and pointing straight. ‚úîÔ∏è Truth: Pick a stance width that allows you to squat as deeply as possible with good form, ideally with your thighs parallel to the floor or lower in the bottom position. The feet can point straight ahead or slightly out to the side (up to 30 degrees). For most people, the ideal stance with is slightly wider than hip width with the feet pointing slightly to the side, but you will need to experiment to see what feels best. Whatever foot angle you choose, make sure the knees move in line with your feet to keep the knees healthy long term.
‚ùå Myth: Don't go past parallel. ‚úîÔ∏è Truth: Descend as deeply as you can while maintaining food form: Stiff spine, heels and toes in contact with the floor, chest facing forward. Squatting deeper generally allows for better leg strength and muscle development.
‚ùå Myth: Don't let your knees go past your toes. ‚úîÔ∏è Truth: If you're squatting deep enough, your knees will likely go slightly past your toes. Ensure that the heels stay on the floor. üëç Here's a great tip: Having a weight in front of the body helps you stay more balanced and thus squat deeper. The weight can be a dumbbell, barbell, or other weighted object. Have more questions or want some more guidance on your fitness? Comment below! My goal is to help time-crunched professionals move and eat well so that instead of feeling defeated by age and work stress, they feel unstoppable.

üëâ2. Bring the arms to the wall and slide them upwards, aiming to straighten the elbows and touch the hands together while keeping the entire arm (including the elbows) on the wall.
Most people will not be able to keep the back of the forearms against the wall the entire movement. Squeeze the shoulder blades together and aim to keep the arms as close to the wall as possible even if they come off the wall.
üëâ3. Keep the arms on the wall as you slide them back to the start position.
üëâKeep lower back neutral (avoid excessive arch) during the exercise. To avoid cheating by arching the lower back, perform exercise while seated with the hips against the wall.

1Ô∏è‚É£At first it seemed impossible; I could not balance for more than 2 seconds. The thing that made me believe that it was possible was that people less coordinated than me have learned to do it.
2Ô∏è‚É£At first, even when I was able to get both feet on the pedals, I kept zig zagging because I had too much tension in my upper body. Only when I relaxed was the bike able to keep moving ahead. This lesson is probably applicable to the rest of life: trying to exert too much effort is counterproductive; sometimes, you just gotta chill a bit. üö¥

.
Silvia is a kinesiologist, personal trainer, and nutrition coach. She became drawn to weight training for its health benefits, as well as its role in improving the body in a way that everyone can participate in.
.
Her friend showed her a YouTube video of an Olympic weightlifting athlete, which sparked her interest. From then, she decided to join an Olympic weightlifting club and got hooked! She was intrigued by the¬†technical skills required by the snatch and clean & jerk, as well as the sense of achievement from seeing herself improve with practice. The ups & downs she experienced as a competitive athlete gave her profound insight about human behaviour and ultimately allowed her to become a better coach.
.
Silvia has been coaching clients with exercise/movement since 2014, but she was never satisfied. Coaching made her realize the flaws with the physical education and healthcare systems in effectively helping people stay healthy and avoid pain/injury.
.
In 2018, she switched from being an Injury Rehabilitation Professional to a Personal Trainer. However, this career change didn‚Äôt provide her relief from her frustrations with the system. She quickly realized that people who needed professional guidance often couldn't put in the time/money.
.
Since then, Silvia‚Äôs mission has been to provide individualized and accessible professional exercise and nutrition guidance, so people can stay healthy and not feel defeated by their bodies. Ultimately, Silvia wants to change the government/institutional policies and practices to make professional, customized exercise guidance as accessible as seeing a doctor.",15,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/104047609_1377735622425413_1948823078604766654_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=C4TQPwscsQcAX-sL9Sk&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfCZ8G4jj0iVvaq8pvpTqNCBJ0KwHZKhs6raMrkNhwb2mA&oe=63D7633C,https://www.instagram.com/p/CBoLifhhOUZ/,17869188892802762,,

‚úîÔ∏èBend at the hips, not at the waist/spine.
‚úîÔ∏èPush the hips forward at the top position to fully lock out (extend) the hips.
‚úîÔ∏èHold the last rep for 10 seconds to further build endurance in the abs.

7,2020-06-13T01:02:40+0000,"You are probably wasting time when you do planks.
Planks are actually a great ab exercise, but so many people do them inefficiently or just plan wrong! Holding for 10-sec at a time is all you need, and if you do it right, your abs will be burning. The keys are how you initiate the plank, the position of your low back, and your intention as you hold. Here's how (this video shows the plank on the knees):
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Start with the elbows directly under the shoulders, forearms parallel to each other, chest pushed away from the floor (not sunken down).
Slowly peel yourself inch by inch off the floor¬†starting the upper abdomen down to the knees. As you do so, you will your abdominals activate starting from the top to the bottom.
Keep back flat by pointing the belly button to the nose. In the final position, the body should almost form a straight line from head to feet. You will feel your butt and abs work to hold the position. Don't let your lower back arch. 
For more intensity, imagine pulling the elbows down to the knees (body stays still, but it increases abdominal activation).

22,2020-06-02T00:01:12+0000,"Getting visible abs takes time. For women, it is particularly challenging and not always possible while staying healthy due to the hormonal changes that occur when getting lean. How long depends on your starting point. If you want abs, you‚Äôre going to need to lose fat, not simply do a lot of ab exercises. Here‚Äôs how to do that:
üëâLift heavy in the gym. Focus on big, compound lifts 80% of the time. This will help build or maintain muscle. It does not mean doing endless amount of ab exercises. In fact, spending a ton of time on just abs means you're missing the opportunity to do the exercises that will have a bigger impact on your physique and function (and train the core at the same time), such as squats, deadlifts, rows, pull ups, presses, etc.
üëâEat in a calorie deficit. This may mean you will feel a dull hunger or have cravings, or at least really change what you're eating.
üëâEat high protein. This will help you build or maintain muscle throughout the process.

You can maintain bone and joint health by loading the bones through either weight or high-impact movements like jumping. Here's a way to get started with higher-impact movement that is joint-friendly: the drop and stick.
üëâ1. Stand up on the balls of the feet and reach up high.
üëâ2. Drop down quickly and stop in a partial squat position (athletic position). Keep your feet pointing forward throughout the entire movement. The band is optional and help teach good knee alignment and activate the glutes more (glutes tend to be ""sleepy"" in office workers).

1. Squeeze the shoulder blades together as you bring the hand to the opposite shoulder so that elbow is at shoulder height.
2. Use the opposite arm to pull the elbow across the body.
3. Keep the shoulder blades squeezed together throughout the stretch so that you feel the stretch on the back of the shoulder joint (where the arm connects to the body) instead of in between the shoulder blades. Hold for 30-60 seconds.

3,2020-05-31T19:00:36+0000,"Here's a case study demonstrating the trade-off between being lean and having flexibility, but that losing fat and keeping it off without meticulous calorie counting or deprivation is still possible once the right habits are in place.
Chloe is a personal training client of mine of over 1 year. Her goal was when we started was to lose fat. Nutrition-wise, I started her with some foundational nutrition habits such as eating to 80% full, which led to good results. When she wanted to lose even more fat after establishing the foundational eating habits, we had her only eat carb-dense foods on workout days. A few months later, she was craving more carb-heavy foods so started eating them daily again, which meant she was no longer at her leanest but still much leaner than when she started. Because she continues her foundational eating habits, Chloe is able to keep eating out all the time and¬†keep off most of the fat she lost. ‚Ä¢

Marshal's goals were to get stronger to counteract his desk job and to decrease his waist size. The photos we took were primarily to track changes in body fat, but one thing that stuck out was how his shoulder posture improved too--note how the palms face the sides of his body like they are supposed to, whereas on the right they face behind him due to very rounded shoulders.
*
*
""You were accepting of my routine and always had ideas to try to address my concerns, using the equipment that I had. That was much appreciated."" Marshal was already training on his own but had hit a plateau with his Gymnastics Bodies program. Some tweaks to the program based on his specific needs helped him progress without adding much more time.
*
*
The fat loss occurred by adding some simple eating habits. No foods were off-limits, he didn't feel hungry, and most importantly, his wife did not need to cook him separate meals (see 2nd photo for a typical day of eating).

5,2020-05-31T06:06:27+0000,"Being able to bend at the hip while keeping your spine rigid is important to keep your back healthy. Back pain is one of the leading causes of missed time from work. Practice the hip hinge pattern so you can use proper form when doing weighted versions of this movement.
How to do it:
1. Start standing nice and tall with good posture. Pretend the spine is stiff as a rod.
2. Fold your body at the hips by pushing your butt back and bringing your head down.
3. Bend down as low as you can without bending the spine. As you approach the bottom position, you will feel a stretch on the back of your thighs/knees and the knees will bend slightly. The shins should stay vertical (the knees should not be significantly forward relative to the ankles).
4. Imaging pushing the floor down with your legs as you stand up. You should primarily feel the muscles on the back of the thighs (hamstrings) and butt (glutes) working as you stand up.

I never look forward to doing squats because they are difficult. But I got started anyway because waiting for motivation means I will never do the thing that is good for me. Today I added another 1 kg to my personal record. Training with heavy weight helps build and maintain bone density, which is super important so you are less likely to get osteoporosis later--something that our sedentary jobs put us at risk for.

üëâInstructions:
1. Stand in the middle of a bath towel folded 1 or 2 times lengthwise.
2. Grasp the towel on either side of the feet.
3. Get into the bottom position of the hip hinge and position the hands so there is no slack in the towel. The hands will be somewhere between knee and ankle height.
4. Try to stand up by pushing the floor down with your legs. Because you are continuing to grip the towel as you do this, your body will remain still despite exerting (this is an isometric hold). Exert for 5-10 seconds. Rest for the equivalent duration before doing the next repetition. Make sure to breath! Start with 5-10 reps .
To advance:
üëâPut in more effort! Isometric holds are a relatively safe way to push yourself. An exception is if you have high blood pressure, in which case more effort and longer holds will increase blood pressure further.
üëâExtend the duration of each repetition to up to 30 seconds.
üëâIncrease repetitions.
üëâDecrease rest time between reps.

No time for gym? No problem. In addition to strengthening your legs, this exercise helps you activate your glutes (which become sleepy with sitting) and stretch your hip flexor muscles (which become tight from sitting, stress, and poor posture). Tips for good execution:
üëâThe feet should be about hip width apart from side to side.
üëâFrom the front view (i.e. if watching yourself in the mirror), the hip, knee, and ankle of the front leg should remain in one line.
üëâThe front foot should remain flat on the floor while only the ball of the back foot in contact with the floor. Both feet should remain pointing forward.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
To advance:
üëâIncrease repetitions.
üëâPerform with weight, e.g. dumbbell(s) or a weighted backpack/purse.
üëâPause at the bottom.
üëâSlow down the lowering phase of every repetition (e.g. taking 4-10 seconds).

No time for gym? No problem. If you need something harder than the regular feet-elevated hip bridge, try it only on one leg (either only when lowering, or for the entire movement). You can progress the exercise by adding reps and/or by holding at the top. To maximize glute activation and avoid putting pressure on the low back, make sure you keep the low back flat (think lift off by peeling the body off the floor from butt to shoulders)

The upper back can get pretty stiff in our modern world, especially if much of your day involves office work. Here's a version of the cat-cow exercise that really targets the spine area between the shoulder blades to help reverse that hunchback posture. Tips:
Push your forearms into the floor to help with extending the spine. You should feel a gentle pressure between your shoulder blades as you arch the upper back.
Take in a deep breath at the end position, then push a bit further with the exhale.
To help the solidify the increased mobility, follow up with some strengthening exercises for the upper back or overhead lifting.

People love to train abs, but often don't do them well even if they do feel the burn in the abs. Ab roll outs are great IF performed properly. If you have a stability ball or barbell with bumpers, use those. Otherwise, wheeled furniture can work too. Tips:
- From start to finish of every rep, keep your tail bone tucked down (belly button pointing to your nose) so your low back doesn't arch excessively.
- Keep your body in a straight line from head to knees. Do not bend at the hips when lowering. You will feel your glutes engage if you do this.
- Only go as low as you can while keeping your low back flat. Push your arms down and pull them towards you to get back to the start position (don't stick the butt up as you return).
- You should really feel the abs work without pressure in the low back.

üèãÔ∏èThe foundational nutrition habits to get and stay lean without counting calories/macros
üèãÔ∏èHow to eat to support training and competition
üèãÔ∏èHow to know if you are eating too much or too little

üëâWhen you first try this exercise, keep the toes tucked underneath your heels. Push through the toes to help you return back up. If you want to challenge yourself more, perform this with the toes pointed away from your shins.
üëâThe body rigid except for at the knee joint, where all the movement occurs.
üëâTuck the tailbone down and keep the low back flat throughout to avoid putting pressure on the low back.
üëâThe lower you go, the harder it will be. You can perform this in front of the couch or wall to have a target to aim for (and so you aren't worried about falling). Move closer to the target if it is too difficult. üëâIf you want to feel more in the abs, hold the bottom position for up 10-30 seconds.
üëâTo make each rep harder, perform with the arms overhead, descend more slowly, or add a longer hold at the bottom.
üëâIf this movement really bothers your knees when you descend, it could mean your muscles are super tight!

Nina is a frontline healthcare worker. She had always wanted to be able to do a full push up but had never been able to despite trying for a long time by training on her own with push ups on the knees. I did a single virtual personal training session with Nina. In that session, I gave Nina a couple of tips and exercise variations to break through the plateau. 4 weeks later, she was able to do not just her first full push ups, but three!

Nina is a great example of how just a little bit of professional guidance dramatically enhances the results obtained through consistent independent training. That is what I love about online personal training.

6,2020-05-19T19:22:53+0000,"Consistency leads to progress. As we get older, we need to work harder to maintain strength, muscle, and bone density. If you only have limited time for exercise, why not make sure it gives you the most total benefit? 
My routine is super boring, but I can measure the progress directly. Yesterday, I had a 3RM personal record on my front squat; the last time was in 2018 when I was more hardcore. For me, progress is more important than avoiding boredom. 
I don't train hard these days, but I have been training daily since the quarantine. I spend about 15-25 min on 1-2 exercises, and the weekly routine consists of only 5 exercises. Each day, I only aim to do one exercise--anything else is a bonus. It's not the optimal way to make progress, but it is still progress. 
Unstructured exercise is great too. I do those weekly on Zoom with my teams at Equinox and at Engineered Bodies, but I see those primarily as social opportunities with training being a bonus.

12,2020-05-17T20:04:54+0000,"Identity. Who are you? Who do you want to be? 
Our identity shapes our behaviours, often very unconsciously. If want to create a habit, finding a way to align the action with your identity is a powerful way to make you follow through. I learned about the power of identity after my identity as a competitive weightlifter drove me to train 5-6 days a week consistently for the first time in my life from 2015-2018. I never enjoyed working out enough before that time. Unfortunately, I held on to this identity so strongly that it became more important than my health and work. This identity blinded me from logic, and no one was able to shake me from this irrationality. 
For those of you who are having a hard time doing something that you know is good for you or for someone you care for, how is that action aligned with your identity? Is there another identity that is blocking you?

‚Ä¢
No gym? No problem. Here's an even more challenging at-home exercise for the glutes, hamstrings, and core. All you need is a towel and a surface it can easily slide. Aim for as many reps as you can because you can really work those hammies with almost no risk! To maximize glute activation and avoid putting pressure on the low back, make sure you keep the low back flat (think lift off by peeling the body off the floor from butt to shoulders). Need more challenge? Keep the top leg up the whole time so that the other leg is doing all the work!

18,2020-05-15T19:06:25+0000,"Why you need to hold yourself back when you return to the gym
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
After taking weeks off of your usual exercise routine, you'll be tempted to go as hard your body can handle. No matter what you've done in the past, jumping back into heavy or repetitive exercises can be a recipe for injury. That's because the tendons and ligaments lose their ""strength"" faster than the muscles and need to play catch up with what the muscles can handle.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Here's how to transition back to the gym safely:
üí™Compare what you've been doing in the past few weeks with what your usual routine was before. Start with doing something that is reasonably in between the two in terms of intensity and volume. üí™Stay far away from failure for any given set, even if your muscles feel like they can handle more. You'll probably still be sore anyway after the time off. üí™Ramp up intensity and volume gradually over a few weeks. üí™Don't forget to support recovery with good sleep, nutrition, and stress management. üí™Avoid taking OTC anti-inflammatories medications if possible. The soreness you're feeling is actually super important for proper repair of the body, and NSAIDS can impair how tendons and ligaments heal.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
There's no need to rush. You're already going to progress more than you would be by doing more than before. An injury will only further set you back. (Shout out to @mihaelaaa.toma for capturing my last lifting session at the weightlifting club before everything got shut down due to Covid-19).

23,2020-05-13T16:58:37+0000,"How you can do interval training without killing your joints or using equipment.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
High(er) intensity cardio training is superior in many ways to cardio done at a steady pace:
üëâSame or more fitness improvement in less time.
üëâHelps increase muscle mass and fat loss--just compare how a sprinter looks compared to a long distance runner.
üëâDoes not increase appetite and can actually suppress appetite, unlike endurance training. If your goal is fat loss, this is an important consideration!
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Despite this, I still don't recommend sprinting or running for most people because it's hard on the joints, especially since most people don't have good running (or even walking) form to begin with. One way to get the benefits of HIIT cardio is to run up flights of stairs. Running up stairs is actually less stressful on the joints than running on level ground (descending stairs is more stressful on joints, especially if your running technique sucks).
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Here's a stair workout you can try:
üèÉRun up a flight of stairs, ideally a total distance of 1 or more floors but use what you have.
üèÉWalk back down.
üèÉIf needed, take a short rest before repeating.
The recovery time between reps and total workout time will depend on your fitness level and how intense it is. Even a 3 reps will be better than nothing, so just get started! The quicker you run up, the longer the recovery. ‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
No gym? No problem. Turn the basic glute bridge into a real hamstring burner by elevating the feet onto a chair. You can progress the exercise by adding reps and/or by holding at the top. To maximize glute activation and avoid putting pressure on the low back, make sure you keep the low back flat (think lift off by peeling the body off the floor from butt to shoulders).

Before working in health and fitness, I worked in research labs and had ambitions in becoming a physician. Despite my degree in kinesiology, I struggled to exercise consistently. We know it's important to exercise and eat healthily, but so many people face barriers to doing so. As an analytical person who loves to solve problems, I want to know how to help you take care of their health in an evidence-based and practical way (while finding ""motivation"" is useful, it is also important to look at other factors).

18,2020-05-07T04:07:52+0000,"What's the best technique for lifting? üèãÔ∏èFor reaching/lifting below waist height, the movement chosen will be somewhere on the continuum of 2 extremes: (1)  A ‚Äúsquat‚Äù strategy (or lunge strategy), where the knees bend a lot. The muscles on the front of the thighs are the main muscles involved and there is more pressure on the knees compared to the hinge strategy. (2)  A ‚Äúhinge‚Äù strategy, where most of the bending happens at the knees. The muscles on the back of the thighs, glutes, and low back muscles are the main muscles involved, and there is more pressure on the low back and hips.

What strategy should you choose? That will depend on: ‚Ä¢ The shape of the object and other spatial constraints. For example, if you are lifting something in and out of a waist-height trash bin, squatting won‚Äôt work. ‚Ä¢ Your abilities, which will be based on your strengths and body proportions. ‚Ä¢ Whether or not you have any pain/injuries. A squat/lunge strategy might not feel good for someone with knee issues. A hinge strategy might not feel good for someone with low back or hip issues. 
When lifting everyday objects at home or at work, using a hybrid approach will be most suitable most of the time. This equally balances the pressure amongst the knees and back and will generally allow you to feel the strongest.

She struggled with cravings (especially sweets) and wanted help with her nutrition so she could be healthier and lose fat without giving up her love of eating out and trying new foods. 
While Dawn had a solid foundation of eating plenty of vegetables, I helped her make some additions and swaps in her diet which helped her feel less hungry AND look noticeably slimmer. ""I liked how you were very understanding of my goals, issues, needs and wants. You also took a lot of time to get to know me and my situation.

20,2020-05-05T19:05:50+0000,"Simple Routine to Help You Kick Higher 
Kicking in kung fu, martial arts, dance, and soccer requires you to have flexibility in your legs and coordination so you can kick high and reduce injury risk. If have trouble with kicking due to tightness in your legs, here's a routine that will help. 
1. Leg lower #1: 
This helps you stretch the muscles on the back of your thigh of the top leg. Keep the knee of the top leg straight and toes pointed towards your shin. If you have trouble keeping the knee straight as you lower the other leg to the floor, hold the top leg closer to the floor. Eventually, work towards being able to perform this with the top leg vertical. Perform 2-3 sets of 10 reps. Do more as needed to improve flexibility.
2. Leg lower #2: 
This is almost like leg lower #1 except you need to hold the top leg in position without assistance. You‚Äôll feel your abs work! Take rests as needed. Perform 2-3 sets of 10 reps.
3. Controlled front kick:
This move requires you to actively extend the leg, which will stretch the muscles on the back of the thigh as well as active muscles on the front of the thigh. It also requires you to balance on one leg. Fully straighten the knee as you kick and avoid using momentum. Perform 2-3 sets of 10-15 reps. 
4. Romanian deadlift (stiff-legged deadlift):
You will make great progress simply by doing the 3 exercises above. I love this exercise because you are strengthening muscles as you stretch them, and lifting heavy weight will help you get stronger, build muscle, and strengthen your bones. When done correctly, the muscles on the back of the thighs and the butt will be doing most of the work, but you will also be strengthening your core and back. This exercise can be performed with dumbbells, a kettlebell, a barbell, or odd objects like a bag of rice. If you are not sure how to perform this correctly, get guidance from a qualified professional such as a personal trainer, kinesiologist, or physiotherapist. Perform 3-5 sets of 8-12 reps with good form.

21,2020-05-05T00:48:57+0000,"Romanian (Stiff-legged) Deadlift 
I love this exercise because:
‚Ä¢ It stretches AND strengthens the hamstrings at the same time. Not only does this kill two birds with one stone, but it has a more permanent impact on flexibility compared to a static stretch.
‚Ä¢ It teaches you how to do a hip hinge pattern, which allows to you more safe movement options in everyday life. Unfortunately, a lot of people don't know how to bend while keeping their back safe.
‚Ä¢ It trains endurance of the low back, upper back, and core in addition to the glutes and hamstrings. 
Tips:
‚Ä¢ Pick a weight that you can perform safely for 8-20+ reps. Go lighter than you think you can handle, as you will be limited by the strength of your low back. Perform 2-4 sets.
‚Ä¢ You should feel the back of the thighs and glutes work, especially on the way up.
‚Ä¢ You may feel the low back if the weight is heavy enough, but you should notice it more when lowering down than when standing up. 
If you're still unsure if you're doing this movement correctly, it's always worthwhile to get guidance from a personal trainer, kinesiologist, physiotherapist, or other movement specialist to help you keep your body healthy long term.",11,0,VIDEO,FEED,https://video-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t50.2886-16/95733268_247262736385789_308541780992376972_n.mp4?_nc_cat=107&vs=17866699750774486_1631016844&_nc_vs=HBksFQAYJEdCVEd0QVg5aHBGWDR1QUFBSXpBYW5ZZEtVZ0Via1lMQUFBRhUAAsgBABUAGCRHS0JycXdWZmlzRkRqWkFFQU1EV0JnQU1WM0kzYmtZTEFBQUYVAgLIAQAoABgAGwGIB3VzZV9vaWwBMRUAACasg6%2Bo5uq8PxUCKAJDMywXQDDmZmZmZmYYEmRhc2hfYmFzZWxpbmVfMV92MREAdeoHAA%3D%3D&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=59939d&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InZ0c192b2RfdXJsZ2VuLjcyMC5mZWVkIn0%3D&_nc_ohc=0JjuEKNy6boAX-BnVre&_nc_ht=video-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfCSc5nzYw0zmiUCSAhh2bs0p7nYT9fMaej-AMn13aWZbg&oe=63D2B891&_nc_rid=0d938db858,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_yWCg-BBGc/,18103858171083209,,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/95537382_684438932398586_5566969945087196341_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=WVRqrtxSzzYAX-Hkdhy&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfDwHv1zQKtvP9t23NW2vpGSgjL4DX1y2adu_jIFVHBLXA&oe=63D693F5

Shoulder issues are so common: Whether it's the inability to reach overhead, pinching or pain with certain arm movements, or ""frozen shoulder"" (which I saw in so many female care aides and housekeeping staff), weak shoulder muscles affect people of all ages and fitness levels.

The push up is a strength exercise that doesn't require equipment, but doing them without balancing them out with other exercises can make our shoulders and posture worse than they already are. Here's an exercise requiring no equipment that helps keep you improve posture and keep the shoulders pain-free.

1. Lie on your stomach with your head resting on the floor and arms reached forward in a Y shape (about 45 deg angle from the head).
2. Reach arms forward as high as you can, shrugging the shoulders.
3. Pull your shoulders away from the floor and away from your ears.
4. While keeping your shoulder blades in that position, lift your arms off the floor and hold. It is more important to keep the upper arms reached forward than to lift the arms high.
5. Hold for 10 seconds for 6-10 reps. Feel the muscles in between and on the surface of the shoulder blade activate. For more challenge, perform while holding 1-3lb weights.

The reverse plank can be done without any gym equipment (shout out to Andrew for introducing this!). Tips:
- This can be done for reps and/or as a hold for time. - Pull the shoulders and elbows back to hold the position and you'll feel the muscles on the back of the shoulder and between the shoulder blades working. - You will also be using the muscles on the back of the thighs and glutes.

I like carbs, so I thought I'd feature a few awesome carb-a-licious foods that can replace things like pasta, rice, bread, etc. with more micronutrients and deliciousness. As a #lazycook, I appreciate these things even more because they are require little/no prep to taste awesome (still don't get why anyone would go through the trouble of baking bread; I'd rather use the extra time for something else). Some of my faves:
- Berries, mangos, and other fruits.
- Winter squashes like spaghetti, butternut, and kabocha (!!!). Just toss with some oil and roast!
- Potatoes and sweet potatoes of all varieties. If you haven't already, try some purple, yellow, or Japanese sweet potatoes.

1,2020-05-02T15:41:33+0000,"‚ö°One of the things we‚Äôve definitely learned during the past couple of months is the importance of having some extra food staples in our pantries ‚Ä¶ just in case!ü•´ üò±That can be a real struggle if you have a small kitchen or not much storage. üëâKeeping a supply of canned beans, lentils, quinoa, rice, gluten-free pasta, sauces, protein powder, nut butters, tuna, canned tomatoes, low-sodium soups, and other healthy pantry must-haves can take up a surprising amount of space. üç∑Plus, when your pantry is disorganized, it‚Äôs super easy to forget exactly what you have on-hand, which can cause waste and/or extra trips to the grocery store. üí°Here are some tips to make the most of what you have ‚Ä¶ and stay organized in the process! ‚óè ¬†Add wire baskets that hook underneath your cabinet shelving. Under shelf baskets are inexpensive and can almost double the amount of cabinet storage space.
‚óè ¬†Pick up a wire rack with hooks at the top to go over doors. These come in different sizes and can store spices, cleaning items, etc.
‚óè ¬†Add bars at the rear of your cabinets, and use S hooks to hang up your coffee cups, clearing out needed space. Or hang S hooks on your backsplash to store kitchen utensils, freeing up drawer space.
‚óè ¬†Use a plate rack to organize the covers for all your plastic reusable containers.

‚Ä¢
Train the glutes and upper body at the same time with this variation of the glute bridge. Whether you do this version or a different one, here's something to keep in mind:
üçëExperiment with different feet widths to see which one allows you to feel your glutes the most. For most people, this means the feet will be wider than hip width with the toes slightly pointing to the sides.
üçëFully lock out the hips! The torso and thigh should form a straight line. If you're having trouble with this, it could mean you need to work on either hip or shoulder mobility.
üçëLook forward (this activates your neck and abs).
üçëYou should not feel the back during this exercise. If this happens, work on keeping your tailbone tucked down (or think about pointing your belt buckle to your nose).

Before working in health and fitness, I worked in research labs and had ambitions in becoming a physician. Despite my degree in kinesiology, I struggled to exercise consistently. We know it's important to exercise and eat healthily, but so many people face barriers to doing so. As an analytical person who loves to solve problems, I want to know how to help you take care of their health in an evidence-based and practical way (while finding ""motivation"" is useful, it is also important to look at other factors).

The push up is a strength exercise that doesn't require equipment, but doing them without balancing them out with other exercises can make our shoulders and posture worse than they already are. Here's an exercise requiring no equipment that helps keep you improve posture and keep the shoulders pain-free.

‚Ä¢1. Lie on your stomach with your head resting on the floor and arms out to the side in a ""T"" shape"". 2. Pull your shoulders away from the floor and away from your ears (at the end of the video, I show what this looks like when performed upright).
3. While keeping your shoulder blades in that position, lift your arms off the floor and hold. Keep the arms in line with the shoulder (don't let them drift towards the body) and shoulders away from the ears (not shrugged).
4. Hold for 10 seconds for 6-10 reps. Feel the muscles in between and on the surface of the shoulder blade activate. For more challenge, perform while holding 1-3lb weights.

In response, one of my male friends messaged me saying that my arms were bigger than his and that I was too ""bulky"" (since then, he has apologized). My body has changed a lot in the past few years: gained muscle, lost fat (with disordered eating), gained fat. Negative body image is a very subjective thing, and even when I was 20 lbs lighter at the peak of my weightlifting obsession, I felt like I was not as lean as I should be. *
*
It's one thing to feel insecure about yourself, but when that insecurity results in giving negative feedback about someone else's body, really consider the consequences and remember that you don't actually know what that person has gone through. Everyone has their own struggles which you can't see. I was reminded of this recently when I learned that friends have gone serious mental illness. *

Through help from counselling, I've been able to somewhat quiet down the negative self talk related to my body (please don't send any reassurance or bad mouth this male friend; that is not what this is about). I recommend others do the same if they struggle with self-esteem issues.

Of all the non-caloric sweeteners, erythritol is the one I prefer as it can be used just like sugar, is not synthetic, doesn't have any weird tastes, and doesn't make you gassy. Lakanto is normally about the same price for a much smaller bag, so not a bad deal, Costco!

Again, nothing against carbs, but processed sugar is probably something to limit.

‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢Planks are actually a great ab exercise, but so many people do them inefficiently or just plain wrong! Holding for 10-sec at a time is all you need, and if you do it right, your abs will be burning. The keys are how you initiate the plank, the position of your low back, and your intention as you hold.¬†Here's how:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Start with the elbows directly under the shoulders, forearms parallel to each other, chest pushed away from the floor (not sunken down).
Slowly peel yourself inch by inch off the floor¬†starting the upper abdomen down to the knees. As you do so, you will your abdominals activate starting from the top to the bottom.
Keep back flat by pointing the belly button to the nose. In the final position, the body should almost form a straight line from head to feet. You will feel your butt and abs work to hold the position. Don't let your lower back arch.
For more intensity, imagine pulling the elbows down to the knees (body stays still, but it increases abdominal activation).

Here's a variation of a popular stretch that allows you to stretch and mobilize the whole body (thanks to @seanycollinspt for this one). My favourite part about is how it mobilizes the spine and strengthens the shoulders. To get the most benefit, take a deep breath at each end position, then push slightly further as you exhale. There's many parts to this stretch, so you can choose to do each part the same number of times, or do certain parts more times.

The screw press is similar to the windmill exercise but in a more stable position. It's great for shoulder, spine, and hip mobility; inner thigh & glute flexibility; core stability, and shoulder stability. It is a component of the Turkish Getup, but you can challenge your mobility a bit more by placing your forearm on the floor (to make it easier, reduce the range of movement by stopping once the palm touches the floor).

When calories are equated, none of these is inherently more fattening than the other. The carrots and bananas will be more filling and provide more micro-nutrients, so I would generally recommend those options rather than rice.

Before working in health and fitness, I worked in research labs and had ambitions in becoming a physician. Despite my degree in kinesiology, I struggled to exercise consistently. We know it's important to exercise and eat healthily, but so many people face barriers to doing so. As an analytical person who loves to solve problems, I want to know how to help you take care of their health in an evidence-based and practical way (while finding ""motivation"" is useful, it is also important to look at other factors).

1. Place arms on the wall to make a Y shape with the body. Reach arms up as high as you can, shrugging the shoulders.
2. Depress the shoulders, i.e. pull shoulder blades together and down towards the floor.
3. Rotate the arms so the thumbs point behind you (i.e. externally rotate the shoulders).
4. Move the shoulder blades down away from the ears and towards each other to lift arms away from the wall and hold, keeping the elbows straight and arms overhead. Feel the muscles between the shoulder blades working.

Single leg exercises train the glutes to stabilize the all the joints in the leg, which not only helps you get a round butt, but keep your back and knees healthy!
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢ 
The single leg deadlift, when done properly, is a great exercise that teaches good body mechanics and trains the butt AND the low back. This is important if you're a health care worker handling patients as it reduces your risk of low back injuries, which were common amongst the health care workers I've helped.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢ 
Correct form involves:
- Keeping the spine neutral.
- Keeping the pelvis level (one side should not be higher than the other).
- Feeling the glutes and back of the legs doing most of the work.

(1) Make sure your meal/snack includes plenty of the following nutrients that help slow down digestion and absorption: protein, fibre, and a bit of healthy fat.
(2) Pick foods that are as minimally processed as possible. The more processed it is, the easier it is to eat and digest and the faster it could increase your blood sugar.
(3) Stay hydrated! Sometimes thirst is disguised as cravings for something sweet, possibly because¬†historically, we got water from fruit.
(4) Get enough sleep.

2,2020-04-21T19:06:13+0000,"What does it mean to ""lift with your legs, not your back?""
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
A couple things to consider when it comes to safe lifting:
(1) What is actually happening in the spine?
(2) How strong is your back?
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Like many people, my dad used a squat strategy (knee-dominant, or ""legs"") to lift. He did not understand how to safely bend at the hips without bending the back. The ability to perform a good ""hip hinge"" pattern allows your body to have a wider variety of safe movement options, and also teaches safe spine position for all other movements. While the back muscles are always involved in lifting (or simply even standing upright), proper hip hinging actually primarily uses the back of the legs and the butt to generate most of the strength.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
It took a good amount of practice for him to hip hinge properly, but once he got it, I had him practice the movement with weight (@X3_bar) to really ensure he felt the legs doing more work than the back.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
So how do you make sure you lift safely?
(1) Aim to lift with a neutral spine no matter which lifting strategy you use.
(2) Become stronger than what you need to do! (3) Ideally, learn to use a knee-dominant, hip-dominant strategy, or something in between so you have more options.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
It's always worthwhile to get guidance from a personal trainer, kinesiologist, physiotherapist, or other movement specialist to help you keep your body long term, especially if you already have pain.

3,2020-04-21T15:03:38+0000,"Put your cravings on a time-out.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
One specific tactical strategy for overcoming cravings is to simply wait and sit with the discomfort of not satisfying the craving right away. Set a timer for 20 minutes. If after 20 minutes, you really still feel the need to indulge the craving, then maybe that is what you need in the moment. Waiting allows you to make a deliberate decision that you‚Äôre less likely to regret later. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with indulging occasionally if done mindfully. Often what will happen is that the craving will subside

One way I manage my food environment is by keeping almonds in the garage fridge because otherwise I can easily eat the whole bag--so addictive! I'm in the garage on most days lately because that is where my gym is set up, and today I had to resist the urge of falling into my habit of eating 10-15 almonds while doing some front squats.

Note: There's nothing wrong with eating a few almonds daily, but I need to practice what I preach once in a while, so am participating the 7-day no-snacking challenge I've created.

*
The keto diet has some benefits, though it also has many downsides. If you haven‚Äôt mastered the ability to eat according to hunger levels, you will likely eventually struggle with the same eating issues that you had before.
*
*
Intermittent fasting and time-restricted feeding can be a strategy that many people can adopt fairly consistently long term, but others may struggle with. *
*
Here‚Äôs an approach everyone can use to get some of the benefits of both the keto diet and intermittent fasting: Let your stomach growl before eating! This ensures you get into a fasted state in between meals. *

‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
To me, the main benefit of not snacking/eating until hungry is psychological. In a society where it is so easy to consume calories, eating according to hunger and satiety (e.g. homeostatic eating) is a foundational nutrition skill that would not only reduce rates of overweight and obesity, but also eliminate many of the anxieties surrounding food and bodyweight. There‚Äôs no need to count calories to get and stay at a healthy bodyweight. Furthermore, when you get used to experiencing brief periods of hunger, you learn that it‚Äôs not an emergency and can act accordingly (no need to grab that Snickers bar if you can wait a bit for a nutritious meal instead).
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
I am leading a free 7 day no snacking challenge starting TOMORROW to help you feel more in control of your eating as you stay at home. What you‚Äôll get if you join:
(1) Accountability (and celebrating wins!) from me and from others else in the challenge. (2) Practical strategies to help you get back to a more normal eating pattern
(3) General recommendations on what to include in your meals to support energy and hunger management, whether you cook or get meals delivered. ‚Ä¢

This is an exercise to help keep your shoulders healthy--super important in this modern world. Surprisingly, I've had 20-something female clients who had poor overhead mobility, and this exercise helped them after just a few sessions.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
1. Place arms on the wall to make a Y shape with the body. Reach arms up as high as you can, shrugging the shoulders.
2. Depress the shoulders, i.e. pull shoulder blades together and down towards the floor.
3. Rotate the arms so the thumbs point behind you (i.e. externally rotate the shoulders).
4. Move the shoulder blades down away from the ears and towards each other to lift arms away from the wall and hold, keeping the elbows straight and arms overhead. Feel the muscles between the shoulder blades working.

‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢ If you tend to graze or drink caloric beverages throughout the day, or snack when not hungry, see how you feel with reducing the number of times you eat. This can look different depending on what you are currently doing: ‚Ä¢ If you drink creamy/sugary coffee/tea or pop between meals, cut them out or only have them with meals.
‚Ä¢ If you eat snacks at your desk while working, cut them out (even if they are healthy).
‚Ä¢ If you eat 5 times a day, try eating 4 times per day.
‚Ä¢ If you never experience a growling stomach between meals, wait until that happens before eating.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
There are no hard or fast rules about how to go about this experiment to get benefits. It can take time for you to adjust to eating less frequently. If your brain and body are used to running on carbohydrates most of the time, it will take time for you to become better at using fat for fuel. If you‚Äôre feeling really unwell (e.g. poor mood/energy, dizziness), take a more gradual approach and listen to your body. ‚Ä¢

(1) Lateral squat. ‚Ä¢
(2) Lateral lunge. ‚Ä¢
(3) Lateral lunge to high knee.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Benefits:
‚Ä¢
(1) Train stability and mobility of the hip, ankle, and foot to keep your back and knees healthy.
‚Ä¢
(2) Improve flexibility of your inner thigh and calf without doing yoga.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
 Things to keep in mind:
‚Ä¢
(1) The bending knee should always point in the same direction as the toes.
‚Ä¢
(2) Minimize twisting the torso or leaning it left/right, especially if using heavy weight.
‚Ä¢
(3) For the lateral lunges, point the toe as  you push off the foot.
‚Ä¢
(4) Just like for regular squats, push the butt back and lean the torso forward.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Next Monday Apr 20, I‚Äôll be leading a free 7 day no snacking challenge to help you feel more in control of your eating as you stay at home. What you‚Äôll get if you join:
(1) Accountability (and celebrating wins!) from me or possibility from everyone else in the challenge. (2) Practical strategies to help you get back to a more normal eating pattern
(3) General recommendations on what to include in your meals to support energy and hunger management, whether you cook or get meals delivered. *

‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
I‚Äôm counting down push up variations from hardest to easiest, so if the last one was too challenging, try this one. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢ 
I first created this push up variation for my mom as she had trouble maintaining a rigid torso during knee push ups. This version really focuses on training the upper body with less involvement of the core. (1) Get on your hands and knees. (2) Bend your elbows to lower your torso/head down and FORWARD until the forehead touches the floor, keeping the upper arms close to the body so that they are at 5 o'clock and 7 o'clock. (3) Push yourself back up to the start position OR into child pose. Pushing back into child pose would be easier because it requires less core strength and allows you to use your lower body muscles to pull the butt to the heels. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Did you find any of these push up posts helpful? I‚Äôd love to see a video of your push ups! Need some more trouble shooting? Comment below! My goal is to help people fit exercise and healthy eating into their busy lives so they have the energy and confidence to kick butt in life. ¬ü

19,2020-04-16T18:31:21+0000,"Dawn went to the gym daily and did regular personal training sessions with one of my coworkers. She struggled with cravings (especially sweets) and wanted help with her nutrition so she could be healthier and lose fat without giving up her love of eating out and trying new foods. 
While Dawn had a solid foundation of eating plenty of vegetables, I helped her make some additions and swaps in her diet which helped her feel less hungry AND look noticeably slimmer. ""I liked how you were very understanding of my goals, issues, needs and wants. You also took a lot of time to get to know me and my situation. 
I am eating healthier and better. I know a lot more about nutrition and have changed a lot of my habits, even the ones I thought were 'healthy'. I know that it‚Äôs the types of foods (carbs, veggies, proteins etc.) that are important rather than just eating a bunch of ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù foods. I feel healthier overall.""

I‚Äôm counting down push up variations from hardest to easiest, so if the last one was too challenging, try this one. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢ 
I don‚Äôt know if anyone else uses this push up variation as I invented it for clients who had a tough time with the more common modified push up variations (e.g. back would sag on the way up). 1. Get into a plank position with knees of the floor: Tail bone tucked down so the low back is flat, chest pushed away from the floor so shoulders are in a good position, and neck aligned with your torso. The body should be in a straight line from the knees to the head.
2. Lower down slowly to the floor, keeping your arms at 5 o'clock and 7 o'clock.
3. Push yourself into child pose. If needed, help out the upper body by using your lower body muscles to pull the butt to the heels.
4. Reset and repeat.

A harder version of this one would be to keep the knees off the floor on way down (second video).

Here‚Äôs a list of tips to buy the healthiest yogurt ‚Ä¶ üëâIngredients: Less is more! üç¨ Sugar: Aim for 10 grams or less per serving. Note: there‚Äôs some natural sugar in dairy products, so pay special attention to ‚Äúadded sugar.‚Äù Plain yogurt has the least sugar, but it‚Äôs nothing a few fresh blueberries can‚Äôt fix! ‚ö° Live and active cultures: Yogurt isn‚Äôt yogurt without S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus, but it gets bonus points if it also contains L. acidophilus, which can help you digest it more easily. üî• Protein: Aim for 5 OR MORE grams of protein per serving. Greek usually has the most. Protein not only helps your body repair, rebuild, and recover, but it also keeps you feeling full between meals.
üòãTaste: Find one with a taste you enjoy, because it won‚Äôt do you any good if it just sits in your fridge!
My personal favorite way to enjoy yogurt is plain yogurt with a tablespoon of coconut flour, some @pb.and.me powdered peanut butter, and a pinch of salt (yes, that‚Äôs right!). What‚Äôs your fave yogurt? Let me know in the comments!

I had my dad start with body weight squats with good form (initially, he had a very rounded back and his knees caved in). While I myself do heavy squats with a barbell on my shoulders, my dad did not feel comfortable with this. I also knew that the extra step of having to go to the garage to do so  would be a barrier. I got this cool band set up called the @X3_bar, which has a barbell and platform to allow you to make it heavy without bands digging into the feet/body. It allows him to lift heavier in the comfort of the living room (usually in his pajamas--I made him get dressed properly for this video, and he actually initially put on jeans before changing into shorts--LOL). Here he is demonstrating a zercher squat.

While having a foundation of good movement quality is important, as well as just getting general exercise, lifting heavy provides many additional benefits such as strengthening the bones and improving certain hormones for health.

For those who want to watch their calorie/carb intake, it is particularly good as it fills you up on few calories, in addition to being higher in micronutrients and fibre. In this video, I used 495g (over 1 lb) of raw carrot, which has only 203 calories!

Ingredients: ‚Ä¢ Carrots
‚Ä¢ Avocado oil (or other cooking oil)
‚Ä¢ Salt and other seasonings. I used @leeapproteins seasoned cricket powder and cayenne pepper.
‚Ä¢ Ground beef (got mine delivered to my home from @trulocal). ‚Ä¢

A spiralizer might work too, but those take up way more space, are more tedious to operate, and don't always work on harder items. ‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢
I‚Äôm counting down push up variations from hardest to easiest, so if the last one was too challenging, try this one. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
This is the same as the full push up, except your hands are elevated on a higher surface such as a table, countertop, bench, or barbell on a rack. The lower the surface, the harder it is (I have some clients doing it with the hands on a 6‚Äù plyo box). Unlike wall push ups where you can only lower until the head touches the wall, this variation allows for full range of motion of the upper body, which ultimately is important for developing strength and muscle size. 
1. Get into an elevated plank position: Tail bone tucked down so the low back is flat, chest pushed away from the floor so shoulders are in a good position, and neck aligned with your torso. The body should be in a straight line from the feet to the head.
2. Lower down slowly until the surface touches the bottom of the chest (bottom of the bra).
3. Push up while keeping the torso rigid in a straight line; do not arch the back). ‚Ä¢

My previous push up personal record back in September was 21, but recently, even doing 10 push ups was tiring and I couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around exceeding that previous record. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Applying my knowledge about exercise science and psychology, I decided that to just aim to do one set of push ups almost daily and simply add one rep each day. Within each day, I break down this action into even smaller steps by simply breaking down the set into mini sets within the set: Today I did 19 push ups and in my mind I was doing 3x5+4 reps. I am 3 reps away from breaking my old record. Who‚Äôs going to join me in testing their push ups?!

How long have you been doing push ups on the knees without being able to do a single full push up? I am passionate about getting women to strength train, and a full push up is very challenging exercise for many women. Following a well-designed progressive exercise program will be what ultimately gets you to that full push up. Simply doing knee push ups may never get you there. ¬ü
¬ü
The eccentric push up is the same as the full push up on the way down, but you have your knees on the floor when you push back up. The key points here: (1) The slower you lower down, the harder it will be and thus the better your training effect. (2) Maintain good alignment! Your body should be in a straight line from the head to the feet/knees; don‚Äôt let the low back droop down. (3) Keep your upper arms close to the body, approximately at 5 o'clock and 7 o'clock. ¬ü

It's unbelievable how few people actually do push ups with good form, including people who are otherwise very strong. The most common significant form issues are:
(1) arched lower back (lack of abdominal engagement), (2) not descending low enough (missed opportunity to strengthen the entire range of motion), and (3) elbows flared far from the body (missed opportunity to strengthen the triceps). In my demo of the full push up, notice:
(1) The body is in a straight line from the feet to the head. The low back is flat. In this video, I am looking up (so I go all the way down without kissing the floor), but facing the floor the entire time is even better for strengthening the neck. What we don‚Äôt want is for the head to be lower than the torso.
(2) I descend until my chest is almost touching the floor. (3) My arms are roughly 30 degrees from the body, or at about 5 o‚Äôclock and 7 o‚Äôclock. If I wanted to get the triceps to work more than my chest, I could keep the upper arms as close to the body as possible.

Not having enough carbohydrates in the body can impair your athletic performance and your ability to get good workouts. Beyond that, going low carb for a long time can have other undesirable effects.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢Short term:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢	It can impair your body‚Äôs ability to make melatonin, which is important for falling asleep and staying asleep.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢	If your body‚Äôs blood sugar gets too low while you‚Äôre sleeping, you may wake up prematurely due a rise in stress-related hormones (including cortisol).
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢Long term:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢	The disrupted sleep has a host of other negative effects, including mood issues, lethargy, poor blood sugar regulation, cognitive impairment, and increased cravings.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢	Cortisol levels become disrupted. Cortisol is an important hormone for survival and for feeling energized, but when it is chronically higher than it should be (such as what happens when under any physical or mental stress), it has a lot of negative effects on your health and makes it harder to gain muscle and easier to store belly fat.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢	The chronic state of stress from being too low carb (even if you don‚Äôt perceive it) can decrease sex hormones (e.g. estrogen, testosterone), which has many other serious downsides. Women are more likely to experience this. Other factors that increase risk for disrupted sex hormones from not having enough carbs include high stress levels, high exercise intensity/duration, low body fat, and lower nutrient intake.

Adding weight is not the only way to make an exercise more challenging. The muscles activate more forcefully also when moving FASTER! 
The ability to move quickly is also important in many athletic pursuits and also can keep you safer (e.g. reacting quickly can help prevent a bad fall).
This is a reverse lunge to single leg hop. Things to keep in mind:
	1. Keep the hip, knee, and ankle in alignment when viewed from the front. This applies to both the bottom position as well as when landing.
	2. Point the toes down when you jump to get more power!
	3. Intentionally move the arms explosively in addition to jumping with the legs. Everything in the body is connected, and shoulder power contributes to hip power!
	4. Land softly to minimize joint stress.

13,2020-04-10T15:01:49+0000,"Technically, the calories you get from vegetables and fruits are mostly from carbohydrates. Something like spinach can be LOW carb but still MOSTLY carb. Vegetables and fruit are a great way to get lots of micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other beneficial stuff) as well as fibre, so should generally be included in everyone‚Äôs diet. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

A common misconception people have is that complex carbs are healthy, and I think that‚Äôs partly because they assume complex carbs means fibre (not technically true). While healthier sources of carbs will tend to have complex carbs, many less nutritious foods like white bread, Cheetos, and tapioca pearls are technically mostly complex carbohydrates (starch) as well. What‚Äôs more important‚Äîand likely what most people think of when it comes to selecting better carbohydrates‚Äîis to look at the source:‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

How much micronutrients and fibre does it have?‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

How processed is it?
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Will this make me feel good after, or will it make me feel tired/bloated/anxious/overeat or give me joint pain/acne/brain fog? ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Precision Nutrition‚Äôs healthy eating guidelines uses the term ‚Äúsmart carbs‚Äù, which can include fruit, starchy vegetables, tubers, whole grains, and other minimally processed carbohydrate sources. I love this term because:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
1. It automatically rules out most high sugar foods and selects for higher fibre options.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
2. It does NOT mean you need to include grains in your diet! You can get plenty of carbohydrates from other whole food sources.

15,2020-04-09T15:55:21+0000,"Here are ways to keep your blood sugar levels more stable and keep you fuller:‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

1)	Make sure your meal/snack includes plenty of the following nutrients that help slow down digestion and absorption (and thus slow down the rise in blood sugar after eating):‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
a)	Protein. A major bonus of protein is that it is particularly good for keeping you satiated so you‚Äôll have less hunger and cravings.‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
b)	Fibre (e.g. in vegetables and whole grains).‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
c)	Fat (1-2 thumbs per meal is enough).‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
2)	Pick foods that are as minimally processed as possible. The more processed it is, the easier it is to eat and digest and the faster it could increase your blood sugar. For example, choose:‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
a)	Whole fruits instead of smoothies or purees.‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
b)	Brown rice or oats instead of white rice or bread (even whole grain bread is relatively processed).‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
c)	Whole nuts instead of nut butter.‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
3)	Eat until just satisfied. Even if you eat a nutritious meal with all the above components, the more you eat, the more your blood sugar level increases.‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
4)	Eat slowly. This will help by ensuring you are less likely to overeat and by making the rise in blood sugar more gradual.‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
5)	If you‚Äôre working overnight, try to get your main meal near the start of your shift. Your body‚Äôs ability to digest food and keep blood sugar stable is poorer during the time when it wants to be sleeping.‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
In my next post, I will discuss whether you even need to eat carbs.‚Ä¢

18,2020-04-08T15:55:23+0000,"This is a simple sequence of events explaining how food affects blood sugar:
‚Ä¢ Food/drink is ingested. >> Food is broken down into smaller molecules (digestion). All carbohydrates are broken down into the smallest sugar molecules (except for fibre). >> Molecules of food, including sugar, are absorbed from the gut into our bloodstream. >> Blood sugar level rises. >> Blood circulation delivers the nutrients to cells all over the body. >> Cells absorb the sugar and other nutrients from the blood so they can make energy and function. >> Blood sugar level goes down. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Your blood sugar level is dynamic, and for optimal health and energy, it should remain within a tight range. During a fasted state (e.g. first thing in the morning), you will still have some sugar in your blood at a level that is more or less steady as you rest or go about light activity. The quicker and higher the blood sugar level rises after eating/drinking, the quicker and lower it will drop later on (due to the hormone insulin). Sometimes, the blood sugar can drop even lower than when you‚Äôre in a fasted state‚Äîknown as a ‚Äúsugar crash‚Äù or ‚Äúfood coma‚Äù. This state of having low blood sugar is not desirable. Not only will you feel sluggish and/or grouchy, but also more likely to crave sugary or starchy foods to restore your blood sugar level. Unfortunately, most people will crave something like chips or cookies rather than carrots.‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢Many things affect how quickly and how much the blood sugar will rise after eating/drinking, including: ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢What and how much you ate, and even how you ate. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢Your state of health (e.g. how much muscle you have, if you‚Äôre diabetic or prediabetic). ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢Sleep quantity and quality. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢Exercise and movement. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢Stress levels. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
In my next post, I will focus on how food affects the dynamics of blood sugar levels‚Äîwe all gotta eat, no matter how busy we are! Have more questions or want some more guidance on your own meals and snacks? Comment below! My goal is to help food lovers eat healthier without hating life.

21,2020-04-07T16:40:13+0000,"In the end, the thing that determines your body weight is energy balance: ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Energy balance = ‚Ä¢ the calories your body gets through food (energy in) ‚Ä¢ MINUS ‚Ä¢ the energy your body uses (energy out) ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
The laws of physics dictate that this will always hold true. However, in practice, so many things (physical and psychological) affect either of the two parts of the energy balance equation. For example: ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Some foods may trigger you to eat more calories than you need because they don‚Äôt help you feel full and/or are ‚Äúaddictive‚Äù. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Some foods may make you feel sluggish so you don‚Äôt want to move much, while other foods help you feel energized and ready to crush a work out. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
If you‚Äôve been dieting, your body will slow down its energy use to avoid starvation. A side effect of this is that you‚Äôll move around less and feel more tired. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
If you‚Äôre about to do a boxing match and need to get as many calories as you can right away, eating oatmeal with banana is going to be a lot harder than the equivalent calories of a sugary sports drink. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Various factors affect how many calories you actually absorb from food, such as the type of food, how processed the food is, how quickly the food passes through your gut, and even your gut bacteria. ‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
In summary, you can eat a ton of carbs and maintain or even lose body fat (and many people do) as long as you eat fewer calories than what your body uses. However, unless you‚Äôre a robot, the type of foods you eat and your lifestyle will make it easier or harder. ‚Ä¢

23,2020-04-07T00:02:28+0000,"Carbohydrates (aka ‚Äúcarbs‚Äù) have gotten a bad reputation lately, of with people who don‚Äôt really understand what carbs are. The role that carbohydrates are best known for is providing energy to the body. In order to function, every single cell in your body needs energy. For example, even the cells in your eyeballs need energy or they will disintegrate. Carbohydrates are one of the 3 main categories of nutrients that your body can break down to use for energy (the others are fat and protein), and the amount of energy in food can be measured in calories (more calories = more energy). *
*
Technically, carbohydrates can be classified into 3 main types: (1) Simple carbohydrates or sugars are small molecules of carbohydrates. Examples include table sugar, lactose in milk, and fructose.
(2) Complex carbohydrates are sugars that are linked together to form larger molecules. Examples include any form of starch, such as the starch found in white rice and bread.
(3) Fibre is technically also a complex carbohydrate but is unique in that humans cannot digest it (which is partly why you poop more if you eat more fibre). It is found in high amounts in vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains. *
*
Individual foods often contain a combination of sugars, starches, and fibre. A banana is a great example of this: Greener bananas contain more starch which slowly turns into sugar as they ripen (sweeter means more sugar), and the fibre gives them structure. Some foods will contain one form of carbohydrate more than the others. For example, table sugar is pure sugar with no complex carbohydrates, while the carbs in white rice are almost entirely starch.

Recently, my coach @anthony.agtarap decided to set up a Zoom call during the group training time so he could watch us lift in our home gyms (or in the case of @gdotyee, his living room haha). He was able to give us feedback on the spot, and together we all had a few laughs.

I must admit, I was really not up for lifting today but I had made the commitment and I knew my coach would follow up if I didn't show up. I was also glad to see my fellow team mates. 
The internet allows us many options to stay connected and still get fitness/sport coaching while we practice social distancing. Excited to see how we use technology more and more to make things more convenient!

As much as I love the windmill exercise, I love this variation even more: the bent press! I love it because it gives all the benefits of the windmill (whole-body mobility and stability) BUT allows you to use a heavier weight since you don't have to use your upper body to lift the weight (instead, you get underneath the weight). Using a heavier weight challenges everything even more. Typically, this exercise is done with a kettlebell, but no reason why you can't improvise!

One thing I discovered about myself when doing this exercise is that even though my right arm is stronger than my left (especially for standard overhead/pressing exercises), the shoulder felt noticeably less stable than the left during this exercise. This was because the end of my right upper arm bone was not as well centered in its socket (i.e. my right shoulder was slouched forward), which is actually pretty common in this modern world. Once I pulled my shoulder back to a better position, it felt more stable.

She loves food and eats out more than she cooks. The proudest moment for me as her coach was not only helping her lose fat and get more toned while still eating the same foods, but when she told me how she was able to move a fridge when no one else at her work was able to. Who would guess that this petite person would be the strongest at her work place? [Expires Sunday night] Invitation for health care workers ONLY!

I LOVE helping health care workers get stronger, have more energy, and lose inches off their waist.

And I know it‚Äôs achievable with great coaching.

So I‚Äôve put together a program to do just that. I‚Äôm launching it on June 1st. I can‚Äôt wait to get started!

This is specifically for health care workers who want to lose 1-2 inches off their waist, get stronger, and have more energy in 60 days. It‚Äôs a remote program, so you can join from anywhere in the world. 
Like I said, this opens on June 1. But right now I‚Äôm looking for five health care workers to test-drive it as founding clients at a HUGE DISCOUNT to help me work out the kinks.

I really want to create some great case studies from this, so I‚Äôll be spending one on one time with you to make sure that we maximize results.

So, today only, if you‚Äôre a health care worker who wants to lose 1-2 inches off your waist, get stronger, and have more energy, I‚Äôd like to invite you to become a founding client.

When I officially launch this program in 60 days, the cost will be $500.

Right now, for the first few founding members, I‚Äôm only asking for $197 CAD (~$140 USD). Today‚Äôs your last chance to jump on this deal. If you‚Äôre ready to jump start your fitness, comment ‚Äútell me more‚Äù below or send me a direct message and I‚Äôll follow up with more info. - Silvia

When you work as a front line health care worker, you need your body to be prepared for all sorts of forces (e.g. from patients) and movements that are not symmetrical (e.g. pushing a stretcher with one arm). The suitcase deadlift is not only practical, but a great way to train the core to resist rotation and side bending.

üôä üî•MYTH üî•! ü•îBoth types of potatoes can be healthy choices for your diet, depending on how they are prepared (i.e., not fried!) and your portion sizes. üëâThe facts ‚Ä¶ when it comes to calories, protein, and carbs, they are similar in their content. üí°But ‚Ä¶ white potatoes have more potassium and anti-cancer compounds called glycoalkaloids. 
Potatoes that have been cooked then cooled (hello potato salad!) also contain something called ‚Äúresistant starch,‚Äù which is an indigestible gut-friendly compound that helps you feel full. üí°Meanwhile, sweet potatoes have a lot of vitamin A and antioxidants. They also are a little lower on the glycemic index, which means they make your blood sugar rise more slowly than white potatoes. üëçTHE TAKEAWAY: You can enjoy both kinds of potatoes as part of a balanced and healthy diet.

Which are you favorite!? Let me know below!

Being able to lift heavy weight is not enough. Everyone should do some sort of a single leg exercise to keep the body healthy. Single leg exercises train the glutes to stabilize the all the joints in the leg, which not only helps you get a round butt, but keep your back and knees healthy!  The single leg deadlift, when done properly, is a great exercise that teaches good body mechanics and trains the butt AND the low back. This is important if you're a health care worker handling patients as it reduces your risk of low back injuries, which were common amongst the health care workers I've helped. Correct form involves:
- Keeping the spine neutral.
- Keeping the pelvis level (one side should not be higher than the other).
- Feeling the glutes and back of the legs doing most of the work.

Protein helps shift workers because it helps:
1. Keep you full and your blood sugar stable so you have stable energy
2. Ensure you can fall asleep and stay asleep (tryptophan, which is found in protein, is needed for you to create a hormone called melatonin, which is important for sleep)

Did you know you can buy pre-cooked chicken and pre-cooked shrimp at Costco and many other supermarkets? It doesn't get easier than that. Nuts and hummus have a tiny bit of protein, but are mostly fat, so won't give you quite the same effects.

One big benefit I see to the social distancing requirements is that it's forcing organizations to finally adopt more efficient practices, including within the health care system. One super exciting change is that ICBC (the crown corporation in BC dealing with motor vehicle accidents) for the first time is paying for kinesiologists (professionals who help people rehabilitate from injuries) to provide active rehab to clients through video sessions! I no longer do services for ICBC claims, but I am SO excited about what this means for my profession.

So far, they are only allowing video active rehab sessions temporarily, and only for follow up visits. But now that the kinesiology profession's foot is in the telehealth door, who knows what may come next.  If you need a kinesiologist to help you rehabilitate from an injury, let me know and maybe I can connect you with one of my colleagues.

One thing I hate about the conventional medical system is that they still use antiquated procedures, e.g. inconvenient booking systems and fax machines (!!!). In-person visits can also be extremely inconvenient (especially in remote areas) and not always necessary. You should not have to miss work to attend a medical appointment and spend most of that time waiting and travelling. It's about time for things to change!

*
*
Being stronger makes life easier. Did you know that you can get stronger without necessarily getting bigger muscles? That's because strength is not just based on muscle size, but also the ability for the brain to call on the muscle to do work. *
Think of this: When you learn to play an instrument, it's not because your muscles got bigger to help you have the strength to play it. Instead, it's because you improved the coordination of your body. Coordination applies to your ability to express strength as well, and just like with learning to play the piano, strength improves with practice.
*
A lot of women (and even men) don't want to lift weights because they don't want to ""get bulky"". In reality, it takes either a lot of work or a decent amount of body fat to look bulky. This is a photo of a 2016 gold medalist, Sopita Tanasan. She weighed 48kg (106 lbs) and is shown her snatching 92 kg--almost double her body weight, and far more than what bigger people can lift.
*
To increase strength without growing the muscles significantly, train with heavier weight and fewer reps and sets. And, just so you know, I‚Äôm putting together a brand-new program starting Monday March 30th. This is specifically for front-line health care workers (e.g. nurses, care aides, paramedics, community support workers, and other healthcare workers) who want to lose 1-2 inches off their waist, get stronger and have more energy in 60 days.

I love kettlebell swings and snatches, and it turns out that these water cooler jugs can work for these--you can make it weigh up to 18kg! The sloshing of the water really challenges shoulder and core stability (normally I can snatch with a 14kg kettlebell, but this ~9kg jug was already challenging to stabilize).

*
Here's a couple of exercises I LOVE!
*
*
1. Windmill. I love this because it does so many things! Shoulder, spine, and hip mobility; hamstring &glute flexibility and strength; and core stability. The heavier you go, and harder it is.

2. Bent over row! 
People who lift weights often put a big emphasis on the bench press, but what's even more important are exercises that work on postural muscles, which this exercise strengthens. *

üçéBut there actually are some steps you can take to help your immune system in top shape. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇ‚ÄçTaking action goes a LONG way toward moving you from overwhelmed to empowered.
ü•¶I‚Äôve got a list of healthy immune-boosting actions you can take to get back that sense of control. 
NOTE: Remember, it‚Äôs still super important to follow prevention guidelines for handwashing and avoiding people who are sick ‚Ä¶. even if you follow these steps!
‚óè	Get enough sleep. This can help improve your body‚Äôs natural immune function. Aim for 7-8 hours a night.
‚óè	Keep up with your fitness routine. Moderate to intense workouts lasting under an hour help boost your immune system both immediately and in the long run. ‚óè	Cut back on your stress with scheduled downtime and breathing exercises. Chronic stress appears to wear down your immune system, which can make you more vulnerable to illness. ‚óè	Eat a healthy & balanced diet that‚Äôs low in sugar: A balanced diet that contains veggies, fruits, and healthy fats is rich in antioxidants and micronutrients that support your immune system.
‚óè	Stay hydrated. Drinking enough water makes it easier for your cells to do their job ‚Äì plus allows your body to more easily process food and eliminate waste. Shoot for at least 8 8-ounce (240 ml) glasses a day.",2,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/90087756_1488845831293612_7072543340990655812_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=zO4fETcWJtsAX8vus1_&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfCu6yKqCzgZ8PAh6mVr25Cg3scOI0YmSFPc4Hugu4R8eg&oe=63D6DB71,https://www.instagram.com/p/B98BEmnFMLd/,17877670507562688,,

Now that I myself have more free time due to a pause on all in-person personal training sessions, I'd like to finally work on this project that has been on my mind for a couple years: Helping these patient-facing healthcare workers take care of their own health, and do their work with less effort and pain. *

Of course, as I am not one of these professionals, I need more insight! Here's how you can help: All you have to do is to take a minute to do this survey, or share with even one person to whom it applies: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAzbdw3doK07SiztplQyLTWmOyolAKRFpyQWAIE_wmvFd2BQ/viewform?usp=sf_link (link in bio)

It's ironic that those who work in health care often do things that aren't great for their own health. It's during a crisis like this when the demands of taking care of others really challenge the physical and mental capacity of health care workers.

I prefer this over the strict (double arm) barbell press because unlike the barbell strict press, it allows the shoulder to move freely instead of being constrained by the other arm. It also trains the abs AND puts less stress on the shoulder joints and tendons.

üí°üõãHere‚Äôs a simple (and cozy!) way to eliminate some germs and bacteria from your home: make it a shoe-free zone!
üëûIn the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, a lot of us are paying more attention to our exposure to harmful germs and bacteria.
üëüFor centuries, people in some cultures have avoided wearing shoes in their homes, and if you‚Äôre Chinese like me, it‚Äôs the norm. It only makes sense, because our shoes can track in anything they‚Äôve been exposed to out in the world, and studies have shown they actually can be dirtier than a toilet.
Yuck, right?
üö™ü•æIf you‚Äôre thinking of making your home shoe-free, set up a spot to store shoes as soon as people come in the door, with a chair nearby that makes it easy to put on/take off footwear. üë†Then, clean your floors to get rid of loose dirt and mop with a warm solution of mild disinfectant that‚Äôs designed for your flooring.
‚úÖThat way, your feet will be less likely to pick bacteria that are lingering after being tracked in by your shoes.

Many people don't sign up for personal training because they feel they can reach their goals on their own. Even a single session with a qualified coach/trainer can help you make sure you're getting the most out of your training time. I did two personal training sessions with Michael*, whose goals were to get stronger to avoid more sports injuries. Here's what he had to say: ""I liked that you were proactive in suggesting improvements/corrections without waiting for me to ask specific questions about everything, but also that you were able to answer all my questions when I did ask them. You made me feel like you listened to what my motivation and goals were, and that the things we worked were very specific to my goals. 
I did not have any reservations about you as a trainer, we talked before and I felt very comfortable that you know what you're talking. Mostly I had reservations about how much value I could get from single sessions, because I knew I wouldn't be signing up for ongoing training.

I felt that you listened and understood my goals before our session. For this reason I had more confidence that the training would be more focused and efficient. 
It's a pleasure working with you, Silvia."" *Name changed for privacy

I‚Äôm a pretty #lazycook, so having a few condiments on hand keeps food tasty, healthy, and easy. ‚úÖ Here are a few things I always have on hand: - @pb.and.me powdered peanut butter and hazelnut butter powder (both sugar-free)‚Äînot only does it substitute for nut butter in smoothies and salad dressings, or for flour in baked goods, but I can eat straight up nut butter without the guilt!
- Coconut aminos, which I primarily use in salads. It is a sweeter alternative to soy sauce.
- Ketchup! Found this Canadian brand, @goodfoodforgood, which sweetens the ketchup with dates instead of sugar.
- @leapproteins all-purpose spice mix, which I‚Äôve been loving as it makes my my potato, yam, and carrot ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù taste like pasta in marinara sauce. Bonus: It‚Äôs a source of sustainable animal protein: crickets (but you wouldn‚Äôt know from tasting it)!

üî•FACT üî•! üí™We used to believe that stretching before your workout was a big part of avoiding injury, but it turns out it‚Äôs actually NOT. üëâResearchers believe that stretching before a workout can tire out your muscles before you get to the part where you‚Äôre actually doing work!* üí°Instead it‚Äôs a good idea to warm up before you work out by doing ‚Äúbig‚Äù dynamic movements that mimic what‚Äôs going to happen you in your workout or other dynamic flexibility exercises which a skilled movement professional can customize for you. üëçTHE TAKEAWAY: Stretch your body‚Äôs major muscle groups AFTER your workout when your muscles are warm, or at another point during the day, at least 2-3x a week. üëüIs a dynamic warm-up already part of your workout prep?! Any questions? Let me know below ... * Note: Certain static stretches may be beneficial to help you get into better positions during exercises. To know which ones are best for you so you make the best use of your time, get professional help from a good personal trainer or coach.

You‚Äôll want to get any kind of rice EXCEPT processed ‚Äúinstant‚Äù rice, because it will crumble with use.

All you have to do to make your heating pad is pour the rice into the sock until you reach your desired length/flexibility, and then tie it shut. üå∫Note: If you want a more soothing experience, add a few drops of pure organic peppermint or lavender essential oil to the rice and mix it well before adding it to the sock. üí°To use your new heating pad, simply place it in the microwave for 1-2 minutes depending on the wattage of your microwave.

When it‚Äôs heated to your desired temp, simply wrap your DIY heating pad around the area you want to target and let it do its job.

Allows you to maximally challenge your legs without being limited by upper body strength/endurance--your legs are way stronger than your arms!
*
You can adjust the weight easily in small increments.

Looks badass!
*
Lifting heavy, especially with the legs, is a time-efficient way of challenging the body.

Stronger legs means longer lifespan!

It‚Äôs time to HALT ‚Ä¶ and borrow a powerful method from the recovery movement. üõë

When you feel like letting go of your healthy new habit, chances are 1 of 4 feelings (or maybe a combo of ALL of them!) are affecting you. ü•¥üò¥That is where the word HALT comes in ‚Äì you might be Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired. ü§Øüò£ We don‚Äôt make the best decisions when we feel any of those things. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs such a good idea to step back for a minute or two. üõëDo a little scan of your current situation to find out what‚Äôs REALLY going on ... and then take action to fix the underlying cause! ‚úåAs in: eat a healthy snack, meditate, take a walk (outside if possible) to get a fresh perspective, reach out to a supportive friend or family member, or even take a nap or go to bed early!

It is absolutely AMAZING what a difference it can make to HALT (literally and figuratively!) when you feel like giving up. It gives you a chance to look a little deeper to figure out why you‚Äôre feeling the way you are, and then take care of yourself. ‚≠ê(And be super proud of yourself in the process!) #doyouevenlift #gainz #vancouver #yvr #fitness  #nutrition #nutritioncoach #personaltrainer",11,0,IMAGE,FEED,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/83711884_488446435200421_2490213907958673182_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=WsCWMbU1eekAX-koJdv&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&oh=00_AfAdJerZrc7oTtT2sHPvwbEa7CAS9MvRmQwmZJjxdWfb3Q&oe=63D6AFC9,https://www.instagram.com/p/B76Utv1h3Jm/,17860375357718363,,

That‚Äôs super important because heart disease is the number one cause of death in the US (also in Australia and Europe!). üí°Some of us are just naturally more positive than others ‚Ä¶ but there are things you can do to reframe your mindset so that you help shrug off those negative emotions. üëâChange your perspective: Practice slowing down and enjoying the moment, vs. rushing to get through things. This is actually a skill you can learn over time.

If your plans get changed or something gets in the way of what you had planned, try to look at it from a different viewpoint. Is there something good that can come from it? (Also, recognize that change is part of life.) üëâSmile! Even when you don‚Äôt feel like it. 
One study showed that smiling (even if it‚Äôs fake) can reduce your blood pressure and your heart rate. üëâTake action. If something is truly bugging you, take action to do something about it. This will help you feel more in control (and positive!) about your situation. üí°Remember this: ACTION alleviates anxiety.

Too many times we go after certain goals because we THINK we should ‚Ä¶ not because we actually want to. üí°If you‚Äôre feeling lukewarm about your goal, do some thinking into WHY you feel that way. üëâIf it‚Äôs still something that you NEED (even if you don‚Äôt want to do it), then try a REFRAME. This could include focusing on the payoff vs. the time/work it will take to make it happen. 
It could be focused on what life will be like AFTER you reach your goal, rather than on the temporary discomfort you may experience to get there. ‚úÖSecond: Be as specific as absolutely possible. Instead of ‚Äúeat clean,‚Äù this could be ‚Äúeat 3 to 5 servings of vegetables every day‚Äù or ‚Äúeliminate added sugar.‚Äù üëâInteresting fact, one study showed that people who focused on more specific goals felt less depression and psychological distress!

That means instead of focusing on that 20 pounds you want to lose ... you focus on prioritizing your workouts, and you have a solid plan for what your food looks like for the week. üî•The same thing goes with anything related to health, career, relationships/hobbies, finances, etc. ‚ú®Sounds so simple, but it makes a MAJOR difference!

‚û° Here‚Äôs why: Having sufficient, good quality sleep is one of the most important things you can do for your health. Melatonin is a hormone your body produces in the evening to help you fall asleep and stay asleep, but its production is suppressed by the blue light emitted from our indoor lighting, not to mention our smartphones and computes. Wearing blue blocking glasses (available on Amazon) filters out blue light so you can restore your body's natural ability to create melatonin and thus get better sleep.
*
*
For me, it‚Äôs a definite must-have (even when other people see me, such as during this party my mom threw for me)! I put it on when I get home, or sometimes even on my way home after training/work. Do you have any ‚Äúmust-haves‚Äù in your daily life?

The same day I heard a completely different story about a man who moved to the US to start a company, but failed miserably on his first try. üòñ

He was devastated and it almost crushed him. After some self-reflection, he realized it wasn‚Äôt the failure, but his crippling fear of rejection‚Ä¶ that was preventing him from living his life again üò£

These two people didn‚Äôt know each other, but they both decided to take the same course of action. 
They were tired of being held back by the fears ‚Ä¶ so they decided to rush headfirst into them! 
Each challenged themselves to do what scared them, for 100 days straight. 
They stepped way outside their comfort zones to do things like rappelling, walking in the subway in their bathing suit, or touching giant, hairy spiders. ü§∫One by one, they faced their fears. In the process, they learned they were capable of SO MUCH MORE than they ever imagined! ü§úü§õThis is so inspiring and empowering. üôå Our society has it all wrong. We like to think of brave people as having no fear ‚Äì but the truth is, you can‚Äôt be brave unless you have fear! 
Without it, there is nothing to overcome.

After her 100 days, the woman started a business to help others (http://100dayswithoutfear.com/), and the the man wrote a book about his rejection quest: www.amazon.com/Rejection-Proof-Became-Invincible-Through/dp/080414138X/) What‚Äôs ONE THING you can do today to further your LIFE in the direction you want to head? üì¢ I‚Äôd love to hear about it!

I became interested in nutrition after I started competing in Olympic lifting and wanted to both optimize performance and get into the 48kg weight class. This interest developed into a passion after the severe food restriction and weight obsession lead to some serious health issues (I may look healthy in the photo, but I was not). That led to me taking the leap into getting my level 2 nutrition coaching certification with Precision Nutrition, which brought me to where I am today, helping everyday busy professionals find nutrition strategies to support their fitness goals without counting every calorie. Reaching goals isn't simply about knowing what to do, but actually finding ways to do the right actions consistently (easier said than done!). ü§©Now, all these years later, I still get fired up when I get to help a new client map out their goal-getting journey with a combination of smart, sustainable exercise and nutrition.

üî•MYTH! üî• üí¶Sweating is actually an important part of your workouts ‚Äì it keeps your body cool. As you get into better shape, your body will become even better at regulating your temperature ‚Äì and that means sweating MORE! üòÖ Also, as you get in better shape, you are able to work out at higher intensities, producing even more heat for your body to disperse (i.e., more sweat!). The takeaway: don‚Äôt be freaked out by sweat. It‚Äôs a good thing! ‚ö°

13,2019-12-14T16:25:09+0000,"‚û° I have 2 scary facts for you ... üíî 1. The more ‚Äúultra-processed‚Äù foods you eat, the more likely you are to do worse on heart-health tests.
üò≤ 2. Most of us get more than 50% of our daily calories from ultra-processed foods! ‚ò£ ‚ÄúUltra-processed‚Äù foods are basically grab & go manufactured foods ‚Äì processed meats, chicken nuggets, soft drinks, cookies & cakes, chips, etc. ‚Äì that contain unhealthy fats, starches, added sugar, and artificial flavors, dyes, and emulsifiers. üçüüç© üíî Scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that for every 5% jump in calories from ultra-processed foods, people‚Äôs cardiovascular health dropped!

So, adults who ate approximately 70% of their calories from ultra-processed foods were half as likely to have ""ideal"" cardiovascular health, as defined by the American Heart Association‚Äôs guidelines.

That‚Äôs compared with people who ate 40% or less of their calories from ultra-processed 
foods. üçéü•¶The takeaway: choose WHOLE ‚ÄúREAL‚Äù FOODS instead of food products that come in a package! This means lean proteins, lots of veggies & fruits, healthy natural fats, and unprocessed grains. üçè

This info comes from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which contained info from 13,446 adults age 20 or older, who completed a 24-hour dietary recall and answered questions about their cardiovascular health.

BUT ... I‚Äôve got a really quick tip for you today... in case you do end up eating more than usual. üëâDid you know that the regular everyday activity you do during the day has a huge impact on how much fuel (i.e., calories) you burn every day? üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇ‚ÄçI‚Äôm talking about simple things like parking farther away in parking lots so you take more steps, taking the stairs instead of elevator, standing instead of sitting, tackling an extra chore at night instead of watching TV, etc. üöó

Keeping busy and active can help cut back on the after-effects of eating foods that aren‚Äôt part of your usual diet. 
Being mindful about your activity level is EXTRA important when you are off your normal routine! (BONUS POINTS: Make sure you stay hydrated by drinking water!) REFERENCE:

0,2019-11-30T15:38:50+0000,"Posted @withrepost ‚Ä¢ @dr.jacob.harden ACTIVE vs PASSIVE : WHEN & WHY?
.
There are a lot of strategies you can use to improve upon range of motion. The range from more general to more specific and from passive to active.
.
Passive strategies for the most part lead to increases in passive ROM. So if you are looking just for some more flexibility in general, they may suffice.
.
Active strategies are used to develop strength, control, and coordination in new ranges of motion. So if you are seeking to improve upon your ability to actively access a ROM via muscular force, then an active strategy would work well.
.
Specific strategies seek to isolate one particular range of motion. While general ones look to develop more global range of motion increases.
.
To put some examples here...
üîπ Foam rolling = Passive / General
üîπ Static stretching = Passive / Specific
üîπ Dynamic warm up = Active / General
üîπ End range training = Active / Specific
.
Which you use really depends on your personal needs and what you feel provides the best results.
.
For example, I find that hip internal rotation responds much better to active strategies than passive ones. Hence me showing an end range training option here.
.
But improving ankle dorsiflexion with a passive approach often suffices.
.
So as you scroll the gram and see unlimited amounts of mobility drills, always be thinking about why you want it in the first place, and that will help you reduce what the best approach is to get it.
.

Here‚Äôs the microwave version of our low-carb, high protein ‚Äúcake‚Äù that‚Äôs ready in just 3 minutes! The recipe shown contains under 140 calories and 9g protein and is best consumed warm.

Ingredients:
- 1 egg
- 6 g (1 tbsp) @pb.and.me sugar-free powdered almond butter
- 2 tsp Westpoint Naturals monk fruit powder or equivalent of another sweetener
- 1 tsp oil (we like avocado oil as it is healthy and flavourless)

1. Blend all the ingredients in a blender for 1 minute. 
2. Pour batter into a mug.
3. Microwave for ~45sec on medium power until cooked through (i.e. an inserted fork comes out clean). Photo shows one batch, blended with an immersion blender. You can also make multiple batches. If using a standard blender, you will probably need to at least double the recipe to get sufficient volume for the blender to blend it properly.

Golden milk, which gets its colour from tumeric, has been consumed for thousands of years for its many health benefits. Here‚Äôs how you can easily make a version that is sugar-free, low-calorie, and vegan!

Mix 1-2 tsp of @pb.and.me sugar-free powdered almond butter, 1/4 tsp of tumeric, and monk fruit powder (or other sweetener) to taste in a mug with a splash of hot water. If you‚Äôd like, add ground cinnamon, vanilla extract, and/or ground ginger to taste. Once the clumps of almond butter are gone, fill the mug with additional hot water. Stir occasionally before sipping as it is normal for the spices and monk fruit powder to settle to the bottom.

We like Westpoint Naturals‚Äô monk fruit powder as it is unrefined and without additives. Click the link in the bio to purchase it on amazon.ca.

1. Pre-washed veggies! Pre-washed salads are easy to find. My other fave pre-washed veggies include broccoli (shown) and cauliflower (frozen cauliflower rice shown). Costco and Whole foods 
2. Pre-cooked protein. Costco sells cooked chicken breasts with minimal ingredients ($14.99 CAD for 1kg, shown in photo), and even no sugar or vegetable oils.
While these items are slightly more expensive than the fresh unwashed versions, you'll save time and it's still cheaper (and often healthier) than eating out.

Today I shopped for groceries at Costco and bought a lot of stuff despite not having a car (and it was raining!). Having large sturdy grocery bags that you can sling over your shoulder allows you to carry more weight.

For breakfast, I  packed roasted brussels sprouts and broccoli, as well as powdered peanut butter mixed with water (not shown). Just because you're on the road, doesn't mean you need to skimp on veggies. Because veggies are low in protein on their own (as long as you don't add dairy), they can last a few hours without refrigeration. All it took for me to prepare the veggies was to toss them in avocado oil, bake in my toaster oven, then sprinkle on salt.

Yes, I ate brussels sprouts in the car!

It was awesome to have these coaches, who coach some very  strong lifters, affirm the importance of keeping a stiff neutral spine when lifting, which I find too many lifters (even strong ones) unaware of. One game changing take-away for me is how to actually create intra-abdominal pressure independent of breathing and by expanding the abdominal wall 360 degrees. Gotta keep practising this!

*
Over a year ago, I decided to shift away from prioritizing strength and competing in weightlifting to prioritizing my career and health. As someone identified strongly with being a weightlifter, letting go of this has been psychologically difficult. Not pushing my strength limits in training and spending less time training less means I cannot expect to break any 1 rep max (or 2-5RM) personal records, and breaking personal records is what makes training rewarding for me. However, I realized there are still many personal records to be made and broken. And that is what I am going to do, starting with rep maximums beyond 6 reps and even AMRAPs. *
*
How can YOU stay motivated to train when life makes it hard to do so? My goal is to help people find ways to keep doing what helps them move well and stay strong. *

2,2019-06-02T16:53:44+0000,"Relaxin‚Äô!
*
Why is it important for women to train the muscles during pregnancy? Relaxin. No, it's not just a lyric in the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air song. *
Relaxin is a hormone that increases during pregnancy to allow the body to adapt to the growing baby and the pelvis to widen during labour. The downside of relaxin is that it causes all the joints to become more flexible so injuries are more likely to happen, even in positions that were previously safe. The sacroiliac joints in the low back/pelvis are commonly problematic, resulting in low back pain or instability during walking/lunging movements.

How do you project the joints when relaxin makes the joints looser? Train the muscles to compensate. Afraid of getting ""bulky""? Keeping the body and joints stable is often a matter of coordinating and ""waking up"" the muscles; in the same way you don't need big muscles to balance on one foot, you don't need big muscles to keep your joints stable and injury-free.

Breakfast is the meal that likely has the most opportunity for improvement. A complete meal should consist of these 4 components:
	1. Protein (1 portion = size of your palm, or ~20g of protein)
	2. Vegetables (1 portion = size of your fist)
	3. Smart Carbohydrates (1 portion = one cupped handful)
	4. Healthy fat (1 portion = thumb-sized portion of a food or 2 teaspoons of oil)

Common breakfasts, even ""healthy"" ones, typically provide plenty of carbohydrates (e.g. breads, oats, cereal, pastries, fruit) but often lack protein (even one cup of milk or one serving of regular yogurt has ~8g of protein) and vegetables. Protein helps keep you feel longer and help you have fewer cravings later in the day. Vegetables are rich in micro-nutrients which have many benefits, and the fiber also keeps you full longer, so why miss this opportunity to consume more vegetables, which most people don't eat enough of anyway?

Here are some options for quick breakfasts that provide a bit more protein and vegetables.
1. Leftovers or whatever you're packing for lunch. Who says you have to eat ""breakfast foods"" at breakfast?
2. Hardboiled eggs with fruit and raw veggies. The eggs can be made ahead of time.
	3. Baked eggs. I like baking because it's a cooking method that you can set and forget without risking burning down the house. You can also make a baked frittata by mixing in veggies, spices, and meat. Once cooked, it's good for a few days in the fridge and can be eaten without heating.
	4. Plain Greek yogurt or cottage cheese with fruit. Bananas or frozen fruit are super easy.
	5. A super smoothie which includes all the 4 meal components listed above (Bonus: If you want me to email you an awesome resource on how to make a super smoothie with example ingredients, email me with the subject ""smoothie""): a. Protein: Greek yogurt, protein powder, cottage cheese, or sugar-free powdered peanut or almond butter. 	b. Vegetables: Spinach, kale, or whatever you like!

At my first provincial weightlifting meet in 2015, I dropped the barbell and it landed on my back. I thought the only issue that the impact caused was a painful low back which went away after a couple weeks without any treatment. Turns out that some of the neck and thoracic spine issues I experienced months and years later were likely caused by the not just the impact of the barbell, but from the consequent movement of the neck. I'm glad this lift was caught on video because it was my athletic therapist, @mcconaghydarren at Coastal Therapy that helped me make that connection and treat my neck/spine issues.
I saw in my notes that the two separate neck strains occurred after the date of this event. I keep a record of my various body symptoms and notes from discussions with my medical providers. This allows me to better take care of my health and not rely on memory. It also helps my health care team to get a better picture of what may be going on.

Yes, that's right. As passionate as I am about helping people feel good in their bodies through movement and nutrition, I don't think people are lazy if they don't live a healthy lifestyle. It's perfectly okay to for career, family, volunteer, and other things to come first. Exercise and healthy eating should not take away from other priorities, but enhance it. 
It's easy for sports coaches and fitness professionals to label people as lazy or unmotivated if they don't meet a certain standard of physical activity. Not only does this perspective hinder the coach's ability to help promote exercise/sport, but it is often untrue. 
What makes it hard for you to exercise and eat healthily, and what support do you need?

Yesterday at work, I was wondering why I had higher cravings than normal for sweet and starchy foods. Luckily, I had banana and peanut butter on hand and managed to resist the temptation to buy food. I then remembered that I only slept 3 hours the previous night and how sleep deprivation results in higher than normal cravings for carbohydrates.

A few things happen that is a lose-lose situation for body shape when we are sleep deprived:
- Appetite-regulating hormones become messed, resulting in food cravings.
- Insulin sensitivity becomes messed, meaning the body's ability to regulate blood sugar and other metabolic processes becomes messed.
- We don't want to move as much, further reducing our ability to handle dietary carbohydrates and fat in a healthy way.

Last weekend, I attended a workshop by @pronatalfitness on how to train pre-and post-natal women. I loved their ""performance-based"" approach on pregnancy and motherhood: both have very high, specific physical demands on the mother's body, just like any athletic event. If athletes do specific, high-intensity physical preparation for their sport, then why shouldn't expectant and new moms do specific, high-intensity physical preparation to prepare their bodies for  carrying an extra 25+ lbs in their abdomen, pushing a baby out, and lifting/carrying a baby with one arm while doing other things the other arm? Simply ""taking it easy"" with exercise is not particularly helpful. *
*
This approach to exercise before/after pregnancy is similar to the approach I used when helping injured workers return to work: You have to train/rehabilitate the stabilizer muscles, train job-specific tasks (e.g. carrying heavy weight on one shoulder), as well as just GET STRONG!

Every time I feel resistance as a patient/client, I reflect on how my own coaching practice and whether I have been effective at helping my clients.
*
My job as a kinesiologist and personal trainer involves recommending exercises to clients. I've seen three different physical/athletic therapists for help to optimize my own movement and address issues, and they each recommended exercises for me to do to address what I went to see them for. Even though I literally paid these therapists to provide me this guidance, I found it hard to do the recommended exercises long-term since they weren't exactly exciting exercises and they ate into my workout time. *
What's the minimum effective dose, or the one thing that will reap the biggest reward? This is something we should all strive to think about instead of thinking in all-or-nothing terms.

Every day is a new day. Every moment is a new opportunity to make a decision which moves you in the direction you want, no matter what the past decisions were.

People who approach food with a restrictive mindset or who assign morals to foods (i.e. ""good"" and ""bad:"" foods) are more likely to experience bingeing once they do get a bite of the restricted/bad food. Scientists call this disinhibition, but it is also known colloquially as the ""f*** it"" phenomenon. 
Next time you feel guilt for eating in a way that is not aligned with your intentions/goals, remember that continuing down that path just because you already ""screwed up"" would be like poking a hole in all your car tires just because one of them is flat.

If knowledge was all that was needed to achieve what we want, we'd all be as rich and fit as we want. Less experienced/effective coaches, including myself before I became more self aware, care more about showing others how much they know (whether it's fancy exercises, technical jargon, or special diets) rather than actually being effective at helping clients make the changes needed to move closer to their goals.*

Are you a lazy cook like me and have a tough time  with eating at least one fist-sized portion of veggies at each meal? Buying veggies pre-washed saves you from the tediousness of washing dirt and bugs off so you get all the nutrient-goodness--the time you save is worth the slightly higher cost. Eating veggies before going to a holiday party will also help fill you up so you're less likely to over indulge.

1,2018-12-01T05:50:41+0000,"Every Olympic weightlifting competition I participate in, I learn a little about myself. In my last competition in August, I learned about how lack of sleep affects digestion and fluid retention: When I weighed myself on the morning of the competition (since there are weight classes for competitors), I dropped over 3 lbs in a 24 hour period after finally being able to get a decent amount of sleep following many days of sleep deprivation. In the past couple months, I also learned how sleep deprivation (i.e. sleeping only 3 hours per night) is associated with very poor digestion, not to mention higher food cravings (salt in the wound!).
*
*
Sleep is so important. In the past, I sacrificed sleep to make sure I could do my gym training. Now, as much as I value exercise for health, I realize that sleeping those extra 2 hours would likely have contributed more to my health and sport performance than those 2 hours in the gym. *
*
Good health involves good exercise, good nutrition, AND good sleep and stress management. Are you getting all of these?
*
I also learned about the power of the mindset and sports nutrition: despite fasting for 24 hours before weighing-in for competition, I still managed to get a personal record by snatching 53 kg/117 lbs, 1 kg more than my previous record.

‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Bad weather stopping you from going outside to walk/run/hike? No treadmill next to your desk?
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Cardio exercise doesn‚Äôt need to be limited to running or cardio machines. Body weight squats can be a great way to get your heart and breath rate up, and you can do them anywhere, anytime! Even better: Squats strengthen your leg muscles and bones more effectively. If you find them easy, here are some ways to make them more challenging:
‚Ä¢
1. Do more reps! If you‚Äôre not out of breath by 50 squats, you‚Äôre probably a Crossfit Games athlete. ‚Ä¢
2. Take 5-10 seconds to descend in every rep‚Äîbe ready for those thigh muscles to get gainz!
‚Ä¢
3. Hold the bottom of the squat for 5-10 seconds, using those muscles to maintain proper position. ‚Ä¢

10,2018-09-03T16:00:45+0000,"Help wanted: Are you or do you know a care aide, nurse, community support worker, or other healthcare worker who struggles with staying fit and healthy? If so, I would love your advice‚Äîit will take just one minute. If you know somebody, please tag them below or share. Survey linked in my bio or at http://silviahua.com/healthcare-workers (or simply http://silviahua.com > click on ‚ÄúHealthcare Workers‚Äù)
*
TL; DR: I would like to get insight from care aides, nurses, community support workers, and other healthcare workers on the challenges they face in taking care of their own health and fitness.*
*
As our population ages and we face a shortage of these health care workers (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/seniors-staffing-shortage-1.4720948), how can we keep patients and workers safe? I believe a key factor will involve addressing the barriers to worker health and fitness. While each individual should take responsibility for his/her own health, simply blaming individuals for not doing so does not help anyone. When your mother ends up in a care home, do you want a care aide who will be able to help keep her from falling, or one who lets your mother fall, as instructed by the employer, to avoid being injured herself (many employers do have such a policy)?*
*
In the occupational rehab program, I had many clients who worked as care aides, nurses, community support workers, and other hospital workers. Back and shoulder injuries from performing patient transfers are common in this group.

*
Did you know that your expectation on how a food will taste influences how you will experience eating the food?
*
People sometimes remark that my food choices are boring, likely because my meals are mostly vegetables and protein and super simple (my #LazyCookIdea hashtag is a clue). I think this is because people associate ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù with boring when it comes to food. *
*
Instead of expecting something to taste good or bad, approach eating with an open mind. Maybe you‚Äôll be surprised about how satisfying and delicious brussel sprouts, potatoes, cauliflower, or carrots can taste (even with not fried or covered in sauce/cheese!). *

""Assumptions make an ASS out of U and ME"".
*
Think of something you're working on but are feeling stuck on. What beliefs do you have about the situation and why you're stuck? Could you imagine a case where these beliefs do not hold true? How can you test these assumptions? *
Example of how to question a belief:
*
Belief: Cake is bad for you.
*
Cake is generally high in calories and sugar, low in nutrients, highly processed, and easy to overeat. *
However, in some scenarios, cake can beneficial: 
A) If you haven‚Äôt eaten for 6+ hours and are about to go for a hard workout, having some carbs from the cake will help you have a better workout and reduce the stress response on your body that would otherwise result from high-intensity exercise in a fasted state.
B) If you are celebrating your grandma‚Äôs 100th birthday and the family is having a special cake made by mom, being able to enjoy the cake and special occasion with your family will do your soul way more good than feeling deprived and left out. *
Of course, in general, having cake for lunch everyday instead of meat and veggies is still not ideal for health in most cases. But it is important to always reflect on how your ideas/beliefs are serving you and be open to other perspectives. *
To get other perspectives, consume information from a variety of sources. Talk to other people and even consider hiring a coach who specializes in the area of interest. *

Eggs and their cholesterol content have been given a bad reputation due to some misinformed recommendations by the American Heart Association in the 70s. Good news: the cholesterol in your food does not actually cause your blood cholesterol levels to worsen. This is because your liver makes cholesterol and will simply make more or less depending on how much you get from your diet.
*
*
That said, diet and lifestyle are still important for the health of your arteries. Even if dietary cholesterol may not be bad for health, SATURATED FAT (another type of fat found in animal products) consumption is one of many lifestyle factors which may affect blood cholesterol levels (though eating too little saturated fat is not ideal either). *
*
Should you limit egg consumption? This study compared prediabetic/diabetic men who consumed 12+ eggs/week with those who consumed <2 eggs/week over for 6 months, with a final follow-up 12 months after the start of the study. Conclusion: The high egg group showed no adverse changes in cardiometabolic markers compared with the low-egg group. *
*
Note for the nerds: 
1. From the Heart & Stroke Foundation site: ""Dietary cholesterol ‚Äì found in meat, poultry, eggs and dairy products ‚Äì has less impact on increasing your blood cholesterol level. Foods that contain lots of saturated and trans fat are the true culprits.""
2. If you look up eggs in the American Heart Association's encyclopedia, it cites that saturated fat is the concern with eggs, not the egg's cholesterol content.

*
TL; DR: I would like to get insight from care aides, nurses, community support workers, and other hospital workers. Please message me or pass this along as relevant!*
*
As our population ages and we face a shortage of these health care workers, how can we keep patients and workers safe? I believe a key factor will involve addressing the barriers to worker health and fitness. While each individual should take responsibility for his/her own health, simply blaming individuals for not doing so does not help anyone. When your mother ends up in a care home, do you want a care aide who will be able to help keep her from falling, or one who lets your mother fall, as instructed by the employer, to avoid being injured herself (many employers do have such a policy)?
*
*
In the occupational rehab program, I had many clients who worked as care aides, nurses, community support workers, and other hospital workers. Back and shoulder injuries from performing patient transfers are common in this group. Despite doing work that demands high physical and mental demands to keep patients safe, this group of faces many challenges when it comes to health/fitness, including doing shift work, not having high income, having certain beliefs and attitudes about health/fitness/pain (most of these clients were immigrants and 99% are women), and of course, being in an environment that primarily focuses on being reactive rather than proactive when it comes to health.

Is cholesterol bad? Well, no. Cholesterol itself is a molecule that is part of every single cell in the body and forms many vital hormones. When it comes to cholesterol in you blood, HDL and LDL are actually like buses that travel throughout the bloodstream with passengers that include cholesterol/fat (e.g. triglycerides). To keep things simple, LDL (the ‚Äúbad‚Äù ones) are the buses that drop off cholesterol/fat from the liver to other cells in the body. They have an important job, but sometimes they crash into the curb and can cause road jams (i.e. plaques). HDL (the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones) are the buses that pickup stranded cholesterol/fat in the blood and bring them back to the liver so they don‚Äôt create problems on the road.
‚àô
‚àô
So how do you improve your blood lipids, i.e. increase HDL, decrease LDL, and decrease triglycerides? I mentioned yesterday that it‚Äôs not about how much cholesterol you eat, though too much saturated fat can be a problem for some*. Saturated fat from the diet is only one factor. Other ways to keep your arteries healthy which may be even more important include:
- EXERCISE!
- Maintaining a healthy body composition (i.e. keep a trim waist; 6 pack optional).
- Eat lots of vegetables and fruit! Fiber also helps reduce blood cholesterol.
- Eat mostly whole foods that are nutrient-dense. Minimize processed food (pasta and bread are processed food, even if whole wheat!).
‚àô
‚àô
* Like your steak but concerned about the amount of saturated fat? Dietary saturated fat is only one factor that influences heart health. Your overall diet quality (e.g. whole foods and minimally processed fat vs. processed food/fat/oil), physical activity level, and overall health also are important.
